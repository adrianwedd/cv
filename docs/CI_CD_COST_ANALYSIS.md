## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Schedule Optimization (40% Reduction)

#### Current vs Optimized Schedules
| Workflow | Current | Optimized | Savings |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| CV Enhancement | 4x daily | 1x daily | 75% |
| Security Scanning | Daily | Weekly | 86% |
| Performance Testing | Daily | 2x weekly | 71% |
| Testing Pipeline | Daily | On-push only | 100% |
| Issue Management | 4x daily | Daily | 75% |
| LinkedIn Integration | 3x weekly | Weekly | 67% |

**Optimized Cron Schedule**:
```yaml
# Critical (Daily)
cv-enhancement: '0 6 * * *'        # Once at 6 AM
production-deployment: '0 7 * * *'  # Once at 7 AM

# Important (2x Weekly)
performance-testing: '0 3 * * 1,4'  # Mon & Thu
staging-deployment: '0 2 * * 2,5'   # Tue & Fri

# Routine (Weekly)
security-scanning: '0 2 * * 1'      # Monday
repository-maintenance: '0 2 * * 1'  # Monday
linkedin-integration: '0 9 * * 3'   # Wednesday
```

### 2. Workflow Consolidation (25% Reduction)

**Merge Similar Workflows**:
- Combine all security workflows into one comprehensive scan
- Merge deployment workflows with monitoring
- Consolidate test suites into single pipeline

**Implementation**:
```yaml
name: Unified Security Suite
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Security scanning
      - Dependency audit
      - Secret detection
      - Vulnerability assessment
```

### 3. Conditional Execution (20% Reduction)

**Smart Triggers**:
```yaml
- name: Check for changes
  id: changes
  run: |
    if git diff --quiet HEAD~1 HEAD -- src/; then
      echo "skip=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi

- name: Run tests
  if: steps.changes.outputs.skip != 'true'
  run: npm test
```

### 4. Resource Optimization (15% Reduction)

**Caching Strategy**:
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      node_modules
      .next/cache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

**Parallel Job Limits**:
```yaml
strategy:
  max-parallel: 2  # Limit concurrent jobs
  matrix:
    node: [20]      # Single version instead of [18, 20, 22]
```

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Workflows Only (Week 1)
**Budget**: $10/month

Enable only:
1. `cv-enhancement.yml` - 1x daily
2. `security-scanning.yml` - 1x weekly
3. `production-deployment.yml` - 1x daily

**Estimated Cost**: $8.40/month

### Phase 2: Add Testing & Monitoring (Week 2)
**Budget**: $15/month

Add:
4. `testing-pipeline.yml` - On push only
5. `performance-testing.yml` - 2x weekly
6. `production-monitoring.yml` - 1x daily

**Estimated Cost**: $12.60/month

### Phase 3: Full Optimization (Month 2)
**Budget**: $20/month

Add remaining workflows with optimized schedules.

**Estimated Cost**: $18.20/month

## Cost Monitoring Implementation

### GitHub Actions Usage API
```javascript
// .github/scripts/monitor-usage.js
const { Octokit } = require('@octokit/rest');

async function getUsage() {
  const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN });

  const { data } = await octokit.billing.getGithubActionsBillingUser({
    username: 'adrianwedd'
  });

  const usage = {
    minutes_used: data.minutes_used_breakdown.UBUNTU,
    cost: data.minutes_used_breakdown.UBUNTU * 0.008,
    included: data.included_minutes,
    paid: Math.max(0, data.minutes_used_breakdown.UBUNTU - data.included_minutes)
  };

  return usage;
}
```

### Budget Alerts
```yaml
name: Cost Monitor
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * *'  # Daily at noon
jobs:
  monitor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check usage
        run: |
          USAGE=$(gh api /users/adrianwedd/settings/billing/actions)
          MINUTES=$(echo $USAGE | jq '.minutes_used_breakdown.UBUNTU')
          if [ $MINUTES -gt 1500 ]; then
            gh issue create --title "⚠️ CI/CD Budget Alert: 75% consumed" \
              --body "Current usage: $MINUTES minutes"
          fi
```

## Quick Reference Commands

### Disable All Workflows
```bash
for file in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
  sed -i.bak '1s/^/# DISABLED FOR BILLING\n/' "$file"
done
```

### Enable Specific Workflow
```bash
sed -i '1d' .github/workflows/cv-enhancement.yml
```

### Check Current Usage
```bash
gh api /users/adrianwedd/settings/billing/actions | jq '.minutes_used_breakdown'
```

## Budget Scenarios

### Minimal ($5/month)
- CV enhancement: Weekly
- Security: Monthly
- No testing automation
- **625 minutes/month**

### Standard ($15/month)
- CV enhancement: Daily
- Security: Weekly
- Testing: On-push only
- Performance: Weekly
- **1,875 minutes/month**

### Professional ($30/month)
- All critical workflows daily
- Full test coverage
- Performance monitoring
- **3,750 minutes/month**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Enable Phase 1 workflows** with strict schedules
2. **Implement cost monitoring** before re-enabling
3. **Set up budget alerts** at 50%, 75%, 90%

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Self-hosted runners** for high-frequency workflows
2. **Workflow queuing** to prevent parallel execution
3. **Smart caching** to reduce build times
4. **Conditional workflows** based on file changes

### Alternative Solutions
1. **CircleCI Free Tier**: 6,000 minutes/month
2. **GitLab CI/CD**: 400 minutes/month free
3. **Self-hosted**: Raspberry Pi or VPS runner
4. **Hybrid approach**: Critical on GitHub, rest self-hosted

## Conclusion

By implementing these optimizations, we can achieve:
- **70% cost reduction** from current baseline
- **Sustainable operations** within $15-20/month
- **Critical functionality** preserved
- **Scalable architecture** for future growth

The key is starting with essential workflows and gradually expanding based on actual usage patterns and budget availability.
