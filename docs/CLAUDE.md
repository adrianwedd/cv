# CLAUDE.md

Essential guidance for Claude Code when working with this AI-Enhanced CV System.

## Project Overview

AI-Enhanced CV System that automatically generates and maintains a professional CV website using GitHub activity analysis and Claude AI content optimization. Runs on GitHub Actions with scheduled workflows.

### 🚀 Quick Start for New Claude Sessions

**Bootstrap Checklist (5 minutes)**:
1. **Context**: Read this CLAUDE.md + check `NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md` for priorities
2. **Health Check**: Run `cd .github/scripts && npm test` to verify system status
3. **Planning**: Use TodoWrite tool immediately to track session progress
4. **Git Status**: Check current branch and uncommitted changes

**System Status Quick Reference**:
- **Current Reliability**: 6/6 systems operational (OAuth, Content Guardian, CV Generator, Analytics, Historical Verification, Elite Agents)
- **CI Status**: ⚠️ ALL WORKFLOWS DISABLED for billing management (August 19, 2025)
- **Authentication**: OAuth-first → API key fallback → activity-only mode
- **Branch Strategy**: Direct to main (CI disabled) - TEST THOROUGHLY before push
- **Test Requirements**: Manual testing required - CI automation temporarily disabled

### 🎯 **ACTION-FIRST DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY**

**CRITICAL**: This project prioritizes immediate action over planning summaries.

**✅ DO THIS**:
- Read `NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md` and immediately start executing objectives
- Use TodoWrite tool to track progress, then begin implementation
- Take action first, document briefly afterward
- Provide concise status updates (1-2 lines max)

**❌ NOT THIS**:
- Long planning summaries before taking action
- Verbose explanations of what you're going to do
- Detailed session analysis without deliverables
- Hypothetical discussions instead of concrete implementation

- **Automation**: GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- **Processing**: Node.js scripts (`.github/scripts/`)

### Key Files
- `data/base-cv.json` - Core CV data
- `index.html` - Main CV webpage
- `assets/styles.css` - Responsive CSS
- `assets/script.js` - Interactive features
- `.github/workflows/cv-enhancement.yml` - Main automation (6h schedule)

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Quick setup
cd .github/scripts && npm install

# Core operations
npm test                     # Run all tests
npm run lint                 # ESLint validation
node activity-analyzer.js    # Analyze GitHub activity
node cv-generator.js         # Generate CV website

# Local development
python -m http.server 8000   # Serve locally
```

## Workflow & Configuration

### CV Enhancement Pipeline
**Trigger**: Every 6 hours  
**Steps**: Intelligence Analysis → Activity Collection → AI Enhancement → Metrics → Website Generation → Deployment

### Key Environment Variables
- `CLAUDE_SESSION_KEY`, `CLAUDE_ORG_ID`, `CLAUDE_USER_ID` - Browser auth (FREE)
- `CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN` - OAuth auth (subscription)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - API fallback (pay-per-token)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub API access
- `AUTH_STRATEGY` - Set to `browser_first` for free usage

## Data Structure

**base-cv.json Schema**: metadata, personal_info, professional_summary, experience, projects, skills, achievements, education

## AI Authentication Priority

1. **Browser Auth (FREE)** - Uses existing Claude.ai subscription via cookies
2. **OAuth ($100-200/month)** - Claude Max subscription with 50-800 prompts/5h
3. **API Key** - Pay-per-token fallback

**Quick Browser Setup**:
1. Extract cookies from logged-in Claude.ai session
2. Run `node setup-claude-cookies.js` to save to GitHub secrets
3. Set `AUTH_STRATEGY=browser_first`

**Enhancement Modes**: Comprehensive, Activity-only, AI-only, Emergency

## Frontend Features

- Responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts
- Progressive enhancement (no-JS support)
- Dark/light theme switching with localStorage
- Structured data for SEO
- Performance optimized (lazy loading, minimal JS)

## Development Guidelines

### Common Tasks
- **Update CV**: Edit `data/base-cv.json`
- **Styling**: Use CSS custom properties in `assets/styles.css`
- **Functionality**: ES6+ JavaScript in `assets/script.js`
- **Workflows**: Test changes carefully (run on schedule)

### Key Constraints
- Respect token budgets (browser mode: unlimited)
- GitHub API rate limits - use caching
- Workflows auto-commit - avoid conflicts
- Browser auth requires valid Claude.ai cookies

## Documentation

Detailed guides available in `docs/`:
- `AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md` - Complete auth setup (browser, OAuth, API)
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Commands, debugging, best practices
- `SYSTEM_INSIGHTS.md` - Critical learnings and patterns

This system maintains a living CV that evolves through intelligent automation while preserving developer control.
   ```bash
   node claude-browser-client.js test --visible
   ```

4. **Save to GitHub Secrets**
   ```bash
   node setup-claude-cookies.js
   # Follow prompts to save cookies to repository secrets
   ```

5. **Update Workflow Strategy**
   - Workflows are already configured for `browser_first` authentication
   - Next workflow run will automatically use browser authentication

### Advanced Cookie Export

For better reliability, export all cookies:
```javascript
// Run in browser console on claude.ai
JSON.stringify(document.cookie.split(';').map(c => {
  const [name, value] = c.trim().split('=');
  return { name, value, domain: '.claude.ai' };
}))
```

### Troubleshooting Browser Authentication

**Authentication Failed (403 Error)**:
- Cookies may be expired - re-export from fresh Claude.ai session
- Try using full `CLAUDE_COOKIES_JSON` instead of individual cookies
- Ensure Claude.ai account is active and accessible

**Browser Timeout**:
- Claude.ai may be slow - increase timeout in browser client
- Check headless vs visible mode for debugging

**CI/CD Issues**:
- Verify GitHub secrets are properly set
- Check workflow logs for browser launch errors
- Ensure `AUTH_STRATEGY=browser_first` is set

### Cost Analysis

**Traditional API Usage** (monthly estimates):
- Light usage (50 requests): ~$10-20
- Moderate usage (200 requests): ~$40-80
- Heavy usage (1000+ requests): ~$200-400

**Browser Authentication**:
- **All usage levels**: $0 (uses your existing Claude.ai subscription)
- **Savings**: 100% of Claude AI costs
- **Limitation**: Must maintain valid session cookies

This system maintains a living CV that evolves with professional development through intelligent automation while preserving full developer control over content and presentation.

## Critical System Insights

### Race Conditions & File Dependencies
- **Issue**: `activity-summary.json` can reference files before they're created, causing intermittent failures
- **Solution**: Always create referenced files atomically before updating summary files
- **Prevention**: Use `fs.mkdir()` with `{ recursive: true }` and verify file existence in workflows

### AI Content Processing
- **Issue**: AI-enhanced content often contains meta-commentary that shouldn't be displayed
- **Solution**: Implement content cleaning logic to extract only relevant enhanced content
- **Pattern**: Use regex to extract content between markers like `**Enhanced Summary:**` and `This enhancement:`

### CSS Variable Dependencies  
- **Issue**: Missing CSS variables cause styling failures that may go unnoticed
- **Solution**: Audit all CSS variables used and ensure they're defined in `:root`
- **Common**: `--color-primary-bg`, `--border-radius-sm` should be `--radius-sm`

### PDF Generation & Deployment
- **Issue**: PDF generated in `dist/` but not accessible in deployed `assets/`
- **Solution**: Ensure PDF is copied to correct location for public access
- **Workflow**: PDF generation happens in cv-generator.js automatically, don't add redundant steps

### Development Workflow Recommendations
- **Current Risk**: Direct commits to main branch affect production
- **Proposed**: Git Flow with `develop` branch, feature branches, and staging environment
- **Benefits**: Production safety, testing isolation, rollback capabilities

### Debugging Best Practices
1. Always verify file existence before referencing in workflows
2. Use comprehensive logging in critical workflow steps
3. Test CSS changes across multiple browsers and themes
4. Validate JSON structure after AI enhancement processes
5. Monitor workflow failures for race conditions and timeouts

## Recent System Improvements (July 2025)

### Content Guardian & AI Hallucination Protection
**Critical System**: Implemented comprehensive protection against AI-generated fabricated content
- **Files**: `.github/scripts/content-guardian.js`, `data/protected-content.json`
- **Integration**: Built into enhancement orchestrator with pre/post validation
- **Protection**: All achievements marked as `protected: true, verified: true`
- **Audit Trail**: Content changes logged with violation detection
- **Usage**: `node content-guardian.js --validate` to check content integrity

### Activity Analyzer Fixes
**Issue Resolved**: Repository counting limited to 20 repos instead of full portfolio (191 total)
- **Problem**: `repos.slice(0, 20)` artificial limitation caused inaccurate metrics
- **Solution**: Implemented pagination with fork filtering for recently active repos only
- **Impact**: Now shows accurate commit counts across entire portfolio
- **Filter Logic**: Excludes forks unless recent commits detected (30-day window)

### Watch Me Work Dashboard Overhaul
**Major UX Improvements**: Fixed data accuracy and presentation issues
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Removes hardcoded repo list, auto-discovers active repositories
- **Fork Filtering**: Only shows forks with recent commit activity to reduce noise
