# üîê ETHICAL AUTOMATION MANIFEST

## LinkedIn Professional Agent Sync

**INTENT**: This automation script helps a user synchronize their own LinkedIn profile into a private CV system using ethical scraping as a fallback method when API access is not sufficient.

This system is:
- User-owned
- Rate-limited  
- Reversible
- Designed for consented professional advancement only

## Configuration Schema

```yaml
playwright_linkedin_integration:
  purpose: "Ethical automation of professional profile management"
  scope:
    - Own profile enhancement
    - Controlled synchronization
    - Intelligence-driven career mapping
  safeguards:
    rate_limit: 1/min
    user_consent_required: true
    tos_compliance_mode: enforced
    anti_spam_protection: enabled
    api_preference: OAuth > scrape
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### üîç Consent Framework
- **Explicit User Authorization**: All operations require documented user consent
- **Granular Permissions**: User controls exactly what data is accessed/modified
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all automated actions
- **Rollback Capability**: Every change must be reversible

### üö¶ Rate Limiting & Respect
- **Conservative Delays**: Minimum 60-second intervals between requests
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic throttling on server pressure signals
- **robots.txt Compliance**: Always check and respect crawling directives
- **Platform Health**: Monitor for service degradation and pause if detected

### üîê Authentication Hierarchy
1. **OAuth APIs** (Primary): Official LinkedIn APIs with proper permissions
2. **Session Cookies** (Secondary): User's own authenticated session
3. **Manual Import** (Fallback): User-provided data export files
4. **No Automation** (Final): Graceful degradation when automated access inappropriate

### üßæ Compliance Integration
- **Terms of Service Monitoring**: Automated ToS change detection
- **Legal Review Triggers**: Flag operations requiring human legal assessment
- **Professional Safety**: Content approval workflows for public-facing changes
- **Platform Relationship**: Maintain constructive relationship with LinkedIn platform

## üìä Transparency Dashboard

All automation activities logged with:
- Timestamp and operation type
- Data accessed/modified
- User consent verification
- ToS compliance status
- Success/failure metrics
- Rollback availability

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Boundaries

### ‚úÖ PERMITTED OPERATIONS
- User's own profile data enhancement
- Consented professional development automation
- Public information research for career advancement
- ToS-compliant API usage within rate limits

### ‚ùå PROHIBITED OPERATIONS  
- Unauthorized third-party profile access
- Mass data harvesting or scraping
- Impersonation or credential theft
- Rate limit circumvention or aggressive automation

## üõ°Ô∏è Safeguard Implementation

### Technical Safeguards
```python
class EthicalAutomation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.consent_verified = False
        self.rate_limiter = RespectfulRateLimiter(min_delay=60)
        self.tos_monitor = ToSComplianceChecker()
        self.audit_logger = TransparencyLogger()
    
    def execute_operation(self, operation):
        if not self.consent_verified:
            raise ConsentRequiredError()
        
        if not self.tos_monitor.is_compliant(operation):
            raise ToSViolationError()
        
        self.rate_limiter.wait()
        result = self.perform_operation(operation)
        self.audit_logger.log(operation, result)
        return result
```

### Human Oversight Requirements
- **Manual Review**: Sensitive operations require human approval
- **Periodic Audits**: Regular review of automation logs and outcomes
- **User Control**: Clear interfaces for user management of automation preferences
- **Emergency Stop**: Immediate halt capability for all automated operations
