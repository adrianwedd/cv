# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **AI-enhanced CV System**! This project represents a next-generation approach to professional CV management, transforming a static document into a dynamic, continuously updated, and intelligently optimized professional portfolio.

## Project Overview

The AI-enhanced CV system is a sophisticated application designed to automate the creation, enhancement, and deployment of a personalized curriculum vitae. It integrates real-time GitHub activity data with advanced AI capabilities (powered by Claude AI) to generate a compelling and up-to-date professional narrative. The entire process is orchestrated through GitHub Actions, ensuring continuous integration and delivery of your professional story.

## Core Vision

Our core vision is to create a **living document** that evolves in tandem with your professional journey. Your career, much like a software project, is continuously integrated with new skills (commits) and deployed for new opportunities (interviews). This system ensures your CV is always current, professionally polished, and ready for viewing, reflecting your latest achievements and expertise.

## Key Features

The system is built on three pillars, ensuring a comprehensive and dynamic CV:

1.  **Activity Analysis**: Quantifying your work.
    *   Automated collection and analysis of GitHub activity (commits, repositories, languages).
    *   Calculation of professional metrics like activity scores, development velocity, and technical diversity.
2.  **AI Enhancement**: Articulating your value.
    *   Leverages Claude AI to optimize professional summaries, experience descriptions, and project impacts.
    *   Provides strategic career insights and skill recommendations based on your activity and industry trends.
3.  **Automated Generation**: Presenting your story.
    *   Generates a dynamic, responsive web-based CV.
    *   Automated high-quality PDF generation for easy sharing.
    *   (Future) Support for ATS-optimized plain text, DOCX, and LaTeX formats.
