**COMPREHENSIVE SESSION CLOSURE REQUEST**

Please perform a complete session wrap-up following these priorities:

### ðŸ“‹ **GitHub Issues Management**
1. **Issue Grooming**: Use the cv-groomer agent to:
   - Analyze and update all relevant GitHub issues
   - Close completed features/fixes with achievement documentation
   - Create strategic follow-up issues for discovered opportunities
   - Update issue priorities and labels for clarity
   - Generate comprehensive backlog health assessment

2. **Achievement Documentation**: For each completed objective:
   - Link to specific commits and code changes
   - Document technical implementation details
   - Record performance improvements and metrics
   - Note any architectural decisions or patterns established

### ðŸ“– **Documentation Updates**
3. **CLAUDE.md Optimization**: 
   - Add **brief** session insights to "Critical System Insights & Learnings (Recent)" section
   - Focus on production architecture status and key technical achievements
   - Highlight operational excellence patterns learned
   - Keep historical details in PREVIOUS_SESSION_WRAPUPS.md

### ðŸ§  **Context Efficiency Analysis**
3.5. **Session Performance Metrics**:
   - **Context Usage**: [X%] of available context window utilized efficiently
   - **Key Files Read**: [count] - optimize for <10 per session for speed
   - **Tool Calls**: [count] - batch operations where possible
   - **Knowledge Reuse**: [X%] - how much prior session knowledge was leveraged
   - **Bootstrap Time**: [X minutes] - time from start to productive work
   - **Objective Completion Rate**: [X/Y objectives] - success percentage vs estimates

4. **NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md Creation**:
   - Strategic planning for next development session
   - Priority ranking based on business value and technical readiness
   - Clear success criteria and implementation estimates
   - Consideration of system dependencies and prerequisites

### ðŸ’¾ **Session Export**
5. **Session Summary Export**: Create comprehensive session documentation in `~/.claude/logs/`:
   - Session date, duration, and primary objectives
   - Major achievements with technical details and impact metrics
   - Challenges encountered and resolution strategies
   - System status improvements and reliability gains
   - Cost optimization results and infrastructure enhancements
   - Strategic recommendations for future development

### ðŸ”„ **Git Flow Management**
6. **Repository Management**: Following proper git flow:
   - Commit all documentation updates with descriptive messages
   - Push to feature branch (not main) with proper branch naming
   - Ensure clean working directory and proper change isolation
   - Consider PR creation for complex changes requiring review
