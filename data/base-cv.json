  "professional_summary": "Systems builder, AI safety researcher, and adversarial thinker with nearly 45 years across the stack. The failure-first methodology didn't come from papers \u2014 it came from coordinating direct actions for Greenpeace's Actions unit against well-resourced opponents where getting the risk assessment wrong had real consequences. That operational security instinct runs through everything: seven years leading cybersecurity, penetration testing, and IDAM for Tasmania's public housing sector; three years of empirical AI red-teaming across 120+ models and 18,000+ adversarial prompts; and production AI systems with hallucination detection and content safety gates built in from the start. Currently freelancing across client delivery (healthcare ecosystems, multilingual sites, ops tooling) and independent AI safety research. AuDHD \u2014 the hyperfocus and pattern recognition are features, not bugs. Most interested in where complex systems break and what that reveals about how they were built.",
