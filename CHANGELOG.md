# Changelog

All notable changes and development insights for the AI-Enhanced CV System.

## Session Insights - August 1, 2025

### Critical Bug Fixes & API Evolution

**Fixed Claude API System Role Error**: The Claude API no longer accepts "system" as a message role. System messages must be passed as a top-level parameter:

```javascript
// Extract system message and pass at top level
if (messages[0]?.role === 'system') {
    requestOptions.system = messages[0].content;
    requestOptions.messages = messages.slice(1);
}
```

### Workflow Enhancement & Visualization

**GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY Implementation**: Enhanced workflows to bubble up valuable metrics directly to GitHub Actions UI:

- Each job now includes markdown-formatted summaries
- Pipeline metrics displayed in tables with costs, tokens, and deployment info
- Job-specific summaries provide granular visibility
- Rich visual feedback without external tools

### Repository Excellence Features

**Comprehensive Repository Enhancement**:

- **Security Policy**: SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting process

### GitHub CLI Power Features

**Advanced `gh` Commands**:

```bash
# Repository management
gh repo edit --add-topic "topic-name"
gh api repos/owner/repo/topics

# Release management
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "Title" --notes "Notes"

# Issue templates
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md

# Enable features via API
gh api repos/owner/repo --method PATCH --field has_discussions=true
```

### Authentication Insights

**OAuth Reality Check**:

- Claude Max OAuth endpoints are not publicly documented
- Current best practice: Use ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- OAuth token setup would require official Anthropic OAuth client
- System designed to support OAuth when/if it becomes available

### Debugging Discoveries

**Workflow Debugging**:

- Many "successful" workflow runs had silent failures
- Enhancement was failing but workflows continued
- Proper error handling and logging essential for visibility
- Check enhancement output files for actual success

### Multi-Repository Management

**Cross-Repository Updates**:

- Enhanced main profile README to showcase CV project
- Categorized project display (AI/Tools/Personal Intelligence)
- Activity section management (note: auto-updated by GitHub Actions)
- Handling merge conflicts with automated updates

### Best Practices Reinforced

1. **Always verify API changes** - APIs evolve, check error messages carefully
2. **Log everything in CI/CD** - Silent failures are worse than loud ones
3. **Use job summaries** - GitHub's UI features are powerful when utilized
4. **Document security early** - SECURITY.md builds trust
5. **Enable discussions** - Community engagement drives growth
6. **Cross-link repositories** - Your projects should reference each other

## Session Insights - August 1, 2025 (Part 10) - CI/CD Pipeline Investigation & Critical Infrastructure Fixes

### Critical CI/CD Pipeline Issues Investigation

**Production System Health Assessment**: Conducted comprehensive investigation of CI/CD pipeline health after user reported 15+ hour stale Watch Me Work data, demonstrating systematic debugging of production infrastructure issues.

#### **Watch Me Work Data Timestamp Issue - CRITICAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem**: Watch Me Work dashboard showing stale data from `2025-07-31T18:25:11.711Z` (15+ hours old) despite successful workflow runs
**Root Cause**: Data processor saving to wrong path (`.github/scripts/data/` instead of `data/`)
**Investigation Process**:

- Analyzed workflow logs to confirm data processing success (100 activities, 17 repositories generated)
- Identified path discrepancy through systematic log analysis
- Found data being generated correctly but saved to wrong location

**Fix Implemented**:

```javascript
// Before: dataDir: path.join(process.cwd(), 'data')
// After:  dataDir: path.join(process.cwd(), '../../data')
```

**Current Status**: Fix deployed (`567ecc6`) but workflow still failing at commit stage due to exit code handling issues

#### **data-refresh-pipeline.yml workflow_dispatch Trigger Failure**

**Problem**: Manual pipeline triggering fails with HTTP 422 "Workflow does not have 'workflow_dispatch' trigger"
**Root Cause**: Complex multiline commit message with embedded shell command substitutions causing YAML parsing errors
**Investigation Evidence**:

- Workflow fails immediately (0s duration) indicating YAML syntax errors
- Multiple fix attempts with comment additions and message simplification
- Trigger syntax appears correct but GitHub API doesn't recognize it

**Attempted Fixes**:

1. Added comment to force GitHub workflow re-parsing
2. Simplified complex multiline commit message structure
3. Removed problematic shell command substitutions

**Current Status**: Issue persists despite fixes, requiring deeper YAML validation or workflow recreation

#### **Advanced Production Debugging Techniques**

**Systematic Investigation Methodology**:

1. **User Report Analysis**: 15+ hour stale data timestamp identification
2. **Workflow Log Analysis**: Deep dive into GitHub Actions execution logs
3. **Data Flow Tracing**: Following data from generation through deployment
4. **Root Cause Isolation**: Distinguishing between generation vs. deployment issues
5. **Fix Verification**: Testing deployed fixes through additional workflow runs

**Log Analysis Excellence**:

```bash
# Effective log analysis commands used
gh run view 16671619124 --log | grep -A 20 -B 5 "watch-me-work"
gh run list --workflow=continuous-enhancement.yml --limit=5
curl -s https://adrianwedd.github.io/cv/data/watch-me-work-data.json | jq -r '.metadata.generated_at'
```

**Critical Learning**: Silent failures are worse than loud ones

- Workflows reported "success" while critical components failed
- Data processing succeeded but commit stage failed silently
- Comprehensive logging essential for production debugging

#### **Data Path Configuration in Multi-Environment Workflows**

**Key Insight**: Working directory context changes between local and CI environments

- Local development: `process.cwd()` = project root
- CI environment: `process.cwd()` = `.github/scripts/` directory  
- Path calculations must account for execution context differences

#### **YAML Workflow Complexity Management**

**Lesson Learned**: Complex YAML structures can break GitHub Actions parsing

- Multiline strings with embedded shell substitutions are fragile
- GitHub API workflow_dispatch recognition can fail silently
- Simpler, more explicit YAML structures are more reliable

### Session Development Methodology

#### **Problem-Solving Approach Excellence**

1. **Systematic Investigation**: User report → workflow logs → data flow analysis
2. **Root Cause Isolation**: Distinguish symptoms from underlying causes  
3. **Fix Implementation**: Target specific root cause rather than symptoms
4. **Verification Testing**: Deploy fixes and validate through production testing
5. **Issue Documentation**: Create comprehensive GitHub issues for tracking

#### **Production Debugging Best Practices**

- **Log Analysis First**: Always examine actual execution logs before theorizing
- **Data Flow Tracing**: Follow data from source through all transformation steps
- **Environment Context**: Account for differences between local and CI environments
- **Silent Failure Detection**: Look for "successful" workflows with failed components
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Capture investigation process for future reference

### Critical Infrastructure Lessons

#### **Watch Me Work Data Pipeline Architecture**

**Current Architecture**:

- Data processor runs in `.github/scripts/` directory
- Saves data to relative path calculations  
- Continuous enhancement workflow commits data changes
- GitHub Pages deployment serves static data files

**Identified Weaknesses**:

- Path calculations dependent on execution context
- Exit code handling preventing successful workflow completion
- Complex dependency chain between data generation and deployment

#### **Workflow_Dispatch Trigger Reliability**

**GitHub Actions Limitations**:

- Complex YAML can break workflow_dispatch recognition
- API errors don't always reflect true YAML issues
- Manual trigger capability critical for debugging and urgent fixes

**Recommended Patterns**:

- Simple, explicit YAML structures over complex multiline strings
- Avoid embedded shell command substitutions in commit messages
- Test workflow_dispatch triggers immediately after YAML changes

### Session Impact & Next Steps
