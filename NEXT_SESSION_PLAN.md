## ⚡ **PRIMARY: Performance Optimization Excellence** (90 minutes)

### **Content Size Optimization - P0 CRITICAL**
**Current Challenge**: Content size 162KB vs <50KB target (3x over threshold)
**Impact**: Major deployment verification score improvement opportunity

**Critical Tasks**:
- **Asset Optimization**: Minify CSS/JS, optimize images, lazy loading implementation
- **Content Compression**: Gzip enablement, resource bundling, critical path optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Separate vendor libraries, on-demand loading for non-critical features
- **Font Optimization**: Subset Google Fonts, preload critical fonts, remove unused weights

**Technical Implementation**:
- Implement webpack/rollup bundling with production optimizations
- Add service worker for caching and performance enhancement
- Enable GitHub Pages compression features
- Optimize structured data and remove redundant meta content

**Success Criteria**: Content size reduction from 162KB → <50KB (target 65%+ reduction)

## 🛡️ **PRIMARY: Security Validation & Enhancement** (60 minutes)

### **Security Score Validation**
**Current Status**: Security headers deployed but verifier shows 25% (expected 80%+)
**Root Cause**: Potential CDN propagation delay or verification pattern issues

**Validation Tasks**:
- **Header Verification**: Confirm security headers properly deployed and detectable
- **CSP Testing**: Validate Content Security Policy effectiveness and browser compliance
- **Security Scanning**: Run comprehensive security audit with external tools
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Address any identified security gaps or improvements

**Advanced Security Enhancements**:
- **Subresource Integrity**: Add SRI hashes for external resources (fonts, CDN assets)
- **Permissions Policy**: Implement Feature-Policy headers for enhanced browser security
- **HSTS Implementation**: Research GitHub Pages HTTPS Strict Transport Security options
- **Security Headers Monitoring**: Implement automated security posture validation

**Success Criteria**: Security verification score >80% with comprehensive protection validated
