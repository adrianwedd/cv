#### **Technical Implementation**
```javascript
async fetchLiveGitHubActivity() {
    // Real-time GitHub API integration
    const response = await fetch(`${CONFIG.GITHUB_API}/users/${CONFIG.USERNAME}/events/public?per_page=30`);
    const events = await response.json();
    const liveActivities = this.processGitHubEvents(events);
    // Smart merging with duplicate detection
}
```
