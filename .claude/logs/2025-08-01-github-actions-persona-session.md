#### ✅ Issue #92: Persona-Driven AI Responses - COMPLETED  
**Objective**: Leverage completed Prompt Library v2.0 system for context-aware AI enhancement

**Implementation Highlights**:
- **Dynamic Persona Selection**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm for optimal persona matching
- **Context Awareness**: Section-specific persona assignment (summary→executive recruiter, skills→technical specialist)
- **Seamless Integration**: Zero disruption to existing enhancement workflows
- **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful fallback to legacy prompts if persona system unavailable

**Key Files Created/Modified**:
- `.github/scripts/enhancer-modules/persona-driven-enhancer.js` - Dynamic persona selection system
- `.github/scripts/claude-enhancer.js` - Modified to integrate persona-driven enhancement

**Technical Architecture**:
- **Context Analysis**: Intelligent section classification and keyword extraction
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Weighted factors including section match, keyword relevance, industry alignment
- **Expert Personas**: 4 specialized personas (Senior Technical Recruiter, Assessment Specialist, Executive Recruiter, Product Manager)
- **Quality Assurance**: Schema validation and improvement scoring integration

**Context Weights Applied**:
```javascript
const CONTEXT_WEIGHTS = {
    section_match: 0.3,        // Primary factor
    keyword_relevance: 0.25,   // Technical alignment  
    industry_alignment: 0.2,   // Market positioning
    seniority_match: 0.15,     // Career level appropriate
    historical_effectiveness: 0.1 // Past performance
};
```

### Technical Insights & Problem Resolution

#### Critical Bug Fix: Method Name Error
**Issue**: `this.loadCurrentCV is not a function` in persona-driven enhancer
**Root Cause**: Incorrect method reference in PersonaDrivenEnhancer class
**Resolution**: Changed `await this.loadCurrentCV()` to `await this.loadCurrentCVData()`
**Impact**: Immediate fix deployed, zero downtime

#### Git Workflow Management
**Challenge**: Multiple remote changes requiring frequent pulls before pushes
**Solution**: Consistent use of `git pull origin develop` before every push
**Result**: Smooth development flow with no lost changes or conflicts

#### Production Deployment Success
**Staging Environment**: Successfully deployed to https://adrianwedd.github.io/cv-staging
**Production Environment**: Auto-deployed via PR #120 merge to main branch
**Validation**: Both features confirmed operational in live environment
