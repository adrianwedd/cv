   - Verify successful CI execution with visible browser debugging
   - Validate 3 consecutive successful runs

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] ES module imports resolved for axe-core
- [ ] 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance on main CV page
- [ ] Career Intelligence Dashboard accessibility validated
- [ ] Accessibility tests running successfully in CI/CD pipeline

### ðŸŽ¯ Priority 2: Cross-Browser Test Suite Completion (#153)
**Playwright Configuration Optimization**

**Current Status**: Temporarily disabled (if: false) due to configuration issues
**Required Actions**:
1. **Playwright CI Optimization**
   ```bash
   cd tests
   # Optimize playwright.config.js for CI/CD environment
   # Ensure browser installation works reliably in GitHub Actions
   # Configure viewport testing for responsive design
   ```

2. **Browser Matrix Testing**
   - Validate Chromium, Firefox, WebKit compatibility
   - Test responsive design across browser engines
   - Ensure consistent CV functionality across browsers

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Remove `if: false` condition from cross-browser-tests job
   - Optimize browser installation for faster CI execution
   - Validate matrix testing across all browser engines

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Playwright configuration optimized for CI environment
- [ ] Browser matrix testing operational (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- [ ] Cross-browser responsive design validation working
- [ ] CV functionality consistent across all tested browsers

### ðŸ”’ Priority 3: Security Vulnerability Resolution (#151)
**Testing Framework Dependencies**

**Current Status**: Low-severity vulnerability in testing dependencies
**Required Actions**:
1. **Investigate and Fix**
   ```bash
   cd tests
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   # Review changes before applying
   # Test framework functionality after updates
   ```

2. **Validation**
   - Confirm vulnerability resolution
   - Ensure all tests pass after dependency updates
   - Update package-lock.json with secure versions

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Security vulnerability resolved
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] GitHub security alert cleared

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Development & Testing (30 minutes)
1. **Accessibility Suite Fix**
   - Fix ES module configuration in wcag-compliance.test.js
   - Test locally with visible browser for debugging
   - Validate axe-core integration works properly

2. **Cross-Browser Suite Fix**
   - Optimize playwright.config.js for CI environment
   - Test browser matrix locally (if possible)
   - Ensure configuration handles CI environment properly

### Phase 2: CI/CD Integration (20 minutes)  
1. **Enable Test Suites**
   - Remove `if: false` conditions from both test jobs
   - Commit changes and monitor CI pipeline execution
   - Debug any remaining configuration issues

2. **Validation Testing**
   - Monitor first CI run for both new suites
   - Address any CI-specific configuration issues
   - Ensure successful completion

### Phase 3: Enterprise Certification (10 minutes)
1. **Consecutive Run Validation**
   - Trigger 3 consecutive CI pipeline runs
   - Monitor for any flaky test behavior
   - Document success metrics and completion

2. **Documentation Update**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with complete testing achievement
   - Close remaining issues with success documentation
   - Update session logs with enterprise certification completion

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Success Metrics
- **6/6 Test Suites Operational**: Complete enterprise testing framework
- **100% WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Professional accessibility standards
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit validation
- **Zero Security Vulnerabilities**: Clean dependency audit
- **3 Consecutive Successful Runs**: Bulletproof reliability validation

### Qualitative Excellence Indicators
- **Enterprise-Grade Quality Assurance**: Professional testing infrastructure
- **Accessibility Leadership**: Industry-standard compliance demonstration
- **Technical Maturity**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive coverage
- **Professional Credibility**: Enterprise-ready portfolio presentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges
1. **ES Module Configuration Complexity**: Modern JavaScript module imports in testing
2. **Playwright CI Environment Issues**: Browser automation in GitHub Actions
3. **Dependency Conflicts**: Security fixes affecting test functionality

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Testing**: Fix one suite at a time, validate before proceeding
- **Local Debugging**: Use visible browser mode for troubleshooting complex issues
- **Fallback Planning**: Maintain working foundation while adding complexity
