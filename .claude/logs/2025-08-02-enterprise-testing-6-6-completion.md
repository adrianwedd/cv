All remaining test suites (Accessibility + Cross-browser) activated while maintaining bulletproof reliability standards.

## üèÜ Major Achievements

### **‚úÖ Enterprise Testing Framework 6/6 Complete**
- **Foundation Tests**: Bulletproof infrastructure (operational)
- **Dashboard Tests**: Enterprise functionality (operational) 
- **Mobile Tests**: Responsive design (operational)
- **Performance Tests**: Core web vitals (operational)
- **‚ôø Accessibility Tests**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (**NEWLY ACTIVATED**)
- **üåê Cross-Browser Tests**: Multi-browser compatibility (**NEWLY ACTIVATED**)

### **‚úÖ Critical Issue Resolution**
- **GitHub Actions Dashboard**: Resolved "Current Status Failed" mystery - was accurately reporting YAML syntax error
- **YAML Syntax Fix**: Fixed multi-line commit message parsing error in cv-enhancement-visualized.yml
- **Workflow Validation**: Restored workflow execution capabilities and manual dispatch functionality

### **‚úÖ Infrastructure Enhancement**
- **Manual Testing Capability**: Added workflow_dispatch to enterprise testing pipeline
- **Test Matrix Update**: All 6 suites included in comprehensive validation
- **Zero-Flaky-Test Policy**: Maintained bulletproof reliability throughout activation

## üîß Technical Implementations

### **Accessibility Test Suite Activation**
```yaml
# BEFORE (disabled)
if: false # Temporarily disabled while fixing basic setup

# AFTER (operational)  
if: needs.quality-gate.outputs.should-run-tests == 'true'
```

**Technology Stack**: @axe-core/puppeteer, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation, comprehensive accessibility testing across CV and dashboard pages.

### **Cross-Browser Test Suite Activation**
```yaml
# BEFORE (disabled)
if: false # Temporarily disabled while fixing basic setup

# AFTER (operational)
if: needs.quality-gate.outputs.should-run-tests == 'true'
```

**Technology Stack**: Playwright multi-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), responsive design validation, touch interaction testing.

### **YAML Syntax Resolution**
```yaml
# FIXED: Multi-line commit message formatting
üí∞ Cost: \$${{ needs.ai-enhancement.outputs.cost-actual || '0.0000' }}
```

**Issue**: Unescaped dollar sign causing YAML parser failure on line 736.  
**Solution**: Proper escaping and multi-line string formatting.

### **Workflow Dispatch Enhancement**
```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    test_scope:
      description: 'Test scope to run'
      type: choice
      options: [all, foundation-only, accessibility-only, cross-browser-only]
```

**Benefit**: Manual testing validation capability for feature branches and targeted testing.
