## 🔧 Technical Implementation Focus

### Containerization Strategy
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build example
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app  
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Infrastructure as Code
```hcl
# Terraform example
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "cv_system" {
  name = "cv-enhancement-system"
  
  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "cv_generator" {
  name            = "cv-generator"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.cv_system.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.cv_generator.arn
  desired_count   = 2
  
  deployment_configuration {
    deployment_circuit_breaker {
      enable   = true
      rollback = true
    }
  }
}
```
