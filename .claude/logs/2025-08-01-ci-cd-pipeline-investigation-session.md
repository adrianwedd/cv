# CI/CD Pipeline Investigation Session Log
**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**Focus**: Critical infrastructure debugging and pipeline health assessment  

## Session Overview
User reported critical CI/CD pipeline issues affecting production site functionality:
1. **Watch Me Work data showing 15+ hour stale timestamps** (high priority)
2. **data-refresh-pipeline.yml workflow_dispatch trigger not working** (medium priority)
3. **Broken staging URL references in documentation** (low priority)

## Investigation Process

### Initial Assessment
- **User Request**: "ensure you track your work in gh issues. proceed: 1. Fix Watch Me Work timestamp generation - This is the critical user-facing issue"
- **Problem Scope**: Data freshness issue affecting user-visible dashboard
- **Current State**: Watch Me Work showing `2025-07-31T18:25:11.711Z` (15+ hours stale)

### Systematic Debugging Approach

#### 1. Data Flow Analysis
**Command**: `gh run list --workflow=continuous-enhancement.yml --limit=5`
**Finding**: Recent workflows showed success but data remained stale

#### 2. Workflow Log Investigation  
**Command**: `gh run view 16671231015 --log | grep -A 20 -B 5 "watch-me-work"`
**Finding**: Watch Me Work refresh job wasn't appearing in successful runs

#### 3. Deep Dive Log Analysis
**Command**: `gh run view 16671561272 --log | grep -A 10 -B 5 "watch-me-work"`
**Critical Discovery**: 
```
üìÅ Data saved to: /home/runner/work/cv/cv/.github/scripts/data/watch-me-work-data.json
üìä Dashboard stats: 100 activities, 17 repositories
‚è∞ Data timestamp: 2025-08-01T09:33:56.009Z
```

**Root Cause Identified**: Data being saved to wrong path (`.github/scripts/data/` instead of `data/`)

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Watch Me Work Data Path Correction
**File**: `.github/scripts/watch-me-work-data-processor.js:27`
**Change**: 
```javascript
// Before
dataDir: config.dataDir || path.join(process.cwd(), 'data')

// After  
dataDir: config.dataDir || path.join(process.cwd(), '../../data')
```
**Commit**: `567ecc6` - üé¨ Fix Watch Me Work data path - critical timestamp issue resolved

### Fix 2: data-refresh-pipeline.yml YAML Simplification
**Problem**: Complex multiline commit message causing YAML parsing errors
**File**: `.github/workflows/data-refresh-pipeline.yml:492-510`
**Change**: Simplified complex commit message with embedded shell substitutions
**Commit**: `1756c1a` - üîß Fix data-refresh-pipeline.yml YAML parsing issues

## Testing & Verification

### Manual Pipeline Triggers
```bash
# Triggered continuous enhancement with forced refresh
gh workflow run continuous-enhancement.yml --field enhancement_intensity=standard --field force_data_refresh=true

# Attempted data refresh pipeline trigger (still failing)
gh workflow run data-refresh-pipeline.yml --field data_sources=dashboard --field priority_level=high
# Result: HTTP 422: Workflow does not have 'workflow_dispatch' trigger
```

### Production Verification
```bash
# Check deployed data timestamp
curl -s https://adrianwedd.github.io/cv/data/watch-me-work-data.json | jq -r '.metadata.generated_at'
# Result: Still showing 2025-07-31T18:25:11.711Z (fix not yet deployed)
```

## Issues Created
- **Issue #125**: üé¨ Watch Me Work data processor workflow commit failure
- **Issue #126**: üîß data-refresh-pipeline.yml workflow_dispatch trigger not recognized

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified data path issue preventing fresh data deployment
2. **Critical Fix Implementation**: Corrected data output path in processor
3. **YAML Simplification**: Reduced complexity in data-refresh-pipeline.yml
4. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive GitHub issues for tracking
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Updated CLAUDE.md with investigation insights

### üîÑ In Progress  
1. **Watch Me Work Data Refresh**: Fix deployed but commit stage still failing due to exit code issues
2. **workflow_dispatch Trigger**: Multiple fix attempts made but GitHub still not recognizing trigger

### üìã Next Session Priorities
1. **Investigate exit code handling** in watch-me-work-data-processor.js causing workflow failure
2. **Validate/recreate data-refresh-pipeline.yml** to resolve workflow_dispatch recognition
3. **Verify data freshness** after workflow commit issues resolved

## Key Learnings

### Production Debugging Excellence
- **Systematic Log Analysis**: Deep dive into GitHub Actions execution logs crucial for root cause identification
- **Data Flow Tracing**: Following data from generation through deployment reveals hidden issues
- **Environment Context Awareness**: CI working directory differs from local development context

### CI/CD Pipeline Health Monitoring
- **Silent Failures Detection**: "Successful" workflows can mask component failures  
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Essential for debugging complex multi-job workflows
- **Path Configuration**: Relative path calculations must account for execution environment

### YAML Workflow Reliability
- **Complexity Management**: Simple, explicit structures more reliable than complex multiline strings
- **GitHub Actions Limitations**: workflow_dispatch trigger recognition can fail with complex YAML
- **Testing Importance**: Immediate verification of workflow_dispatch triggers after changes

## Development Methodology Insights

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **User Report Analysis** ‚Üí Understand immediate impact and scope
2. **Systematic Investigation** ‚Üí Use logs and data flow analysis  
3. **Root Cause Isolation** ‚Üí Distinguish symptoms from underlying causes
4. **Targeted Fix Implementation** ‚Üí Address specific root cause
5. **Verification Testing** ‚Üí Deploy and validate fixes in production
6. **Comprehensive Documentation** ‚Üí Create issues and capture learnings

### Tool Mastery Demonstrated
```bash
# Effective GitHub CLI commands for CI/CD debugging
gh run list --workflow=WORKFLOW_NAME --limit=N
gh run view RUN_ID --log | grep -A N -B N "PATTERN"  
gh workflow run WORKFLOW_NAME --field KEY=VALUE
gh issue create --title "TITLE" --body "BODY" --label "LABELS"

# Production data verification
curl -s DEPLOYED_URL/data/FILE.json | jq -r '.path.to.field'
```

## Technical Architecture Insights

### Watch Me Work Data Pipeline
**Current Flow**: 
1. Data processor runs in `.github/scripts/` directory
2. Generates fresh data with current timestamp  
3. Attempts to save to calculated path
4. Continuous enhancement workflow commits changes
5. GitHub Pages deployment serves updated files

**Weakness Identified**: Path calculation dependency on execution context
**Solution Applied**: Explicit relative path correction for CI environment

### Workflow Complexity Management
**Problem**: Complex YAML with embedded shell substitutions
