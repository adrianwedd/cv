# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to Gemini when working with code in this repository. It reflects my operational principles and key insights gained from past sessions.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-Enhanced CV System that automatically generates and maintains a professional CV website using GitHub activity analysis and Claude AI content optimization. The system runs on GitHub Actions with scheduled workflows for continuous enhancement.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JS website with responsive design (`index.html`, `assets/`)
- **Data Layer**: JSON-based CV data structure (`data/base-cv.json`)
- **Automation Layer**: GitHub Actions workflows for AI enhancement (`.github/workflows/`)
- **Processing Scripts**: Node.js scripts for activity analysis and AI enhancement (`.github/scripts/`)

### Key Files
- `data/base-cv.json` - Core CV data structure (personal info, experience, projects, skills)
- `index.html` - Main CV webpage with structured data and responsive design
- `assets/styles.css` - Modern CSS with design tokens and responsive layouts
- `assets/script.js` - Interactive features, theme switching, and dynamic content loading
- `.github/workflows/cv-enhancement-visualized.yml` - Main automation pipeline (runs every 6 hours)

## Development Commands

## Gemini Added Memories

### Issue Grooming Process

When tasked with grooming issues, I will follow this systematic procedure:

1.  **List and Select**: I will list all open issues (`gh issue list`) to get an overview, then select one to groom, prioritizing older or higher-priority items.
2.  **Analyze**: I will read the issue's current description (`gh issue view <issue_number> --json body`) and inspect relevant code or documentation to validate the issue and understand its context.
3.  **Groom**:
    *   **Draft**: I will draft an enhanced issue description and a comment summarizing the changes. The description will include:
        *   A clear problem statement.
        *   A "Current Implementation" section with findings from my analysis, referencing specific files/lines.
        *   A "Proposed Solution" or "Implementation Strategy."
        *   "Acceptance Criteria."
        *   An appropriate "Priority" (P0, P1, P2, P3).
    *   **Update**: I will update the issue description (`gh issue edit <issue_number> --body-file <temp_file_path>`) and add a comment (`gh issue comment <issue_number> --body-file <temp_file_path>`) that summarizes the changes, highlights key findings, and explains the rationale.
    *   **Metadata**: I will update labels, assignees, or milestones as appropriate using `gh issue edit <issue_number> --add-label "P1: High"`.
4.  **Housekeeping**:
    *   **Close Redundant Issues**: If an issue is a duplicate or fully encompassed by another, I will close it (`gh issue close <issue_number> --reason "completed"`) and add a comment explaining the redundancy and referencing the primary issue.
    *   **Manage Temp Files**: I will use temporary files in the `temp/` directory for all issue bodies and comments to avoid escaping issues and keep the command history clean. I will delete these temporary files after use.

### Python Development Insights

-   **ModuleNotFoundError**: When running Python scripts as `python <script_name>.py`, `ModuleNotFoundError` can occur if the script tries to import modules from a package (e.g., `from src.python.cloud_storage.rclone_client import RcloneClient`). This is because the current directory is not treated as a package root.
    -   **Solution**: Run the script as a module using `python -m <package_path>.<script_name>` (e.g., `python -m temp.process_cv_documents`). This ensures Python's module import system works correctly.
-   **Environment Variable Persistence**: `export VAR_NAME=value` commands executed via `run_shell_command` do not persist across subsequent `run_shell_command` calls. Each `run_shell_command` executes in a new subshell.
    -   **Solution**: Prepend the `export` command to the same `run_shell_command` that executes the script requiring the variable (e.g., `export CLAUDE_API_KEY="..." && python -m temp.process_cv_documents`).
-   **`replace` Tool Limitations**: The `replace` tool is very sensitive to exact string matching. Replacing large, multi-line blocks can be brittle due to subtle whitespace or character differences.
    -   **Solution**: For significant code changes, especially when refactoring or introducing new logic, consider using `write_file` to completely overwrite the file content with the new version. This is more robust than `replace` for large modifications.

### Git Operations

-   **`temp/` Directory and `.gitignore`**: Files within the `temp/` directory are typically git-ignored. This means `list_directory` and `glob` (by default) will not show them, and `git add` will ignore them unless forced (`git add -f`).
    -   **Solution**: When needing to list or access files in git-ignored directories, use `glob` with `respect_git_ignore=False`. If a temporary file needs to be committed (e.g., `requirements.txt` that was initially placed in `temp/`), move it out of `temp/` before adding.
-   **Staging and Committing Specific Changes**: When other changes are present in the working directory, use `git restore --staged .` to unstage all changes, then `git add <specific_files_or_directories>` to stage only the desired changes before committing. This ensures atomic commits.

### Rclone Troubleshooting

-   **Google Drive "Directory Not Found"**: This error often indicates permission issues or an expired token, especially for shared drives.
    -   **Solution**: Reconnect the rclone remote using `rclone config reconnect <remote_name>:` (e.g., `rclone config reconnect gdrive:`). This is an interactive command that needs to be run by the user in their terminal.
    -   **Flag for Shared Drives**: For shared Google Drive folders, the `--drive-shared-with-me` flag is often necessary for `rclone` commands. Ensure the `rclone_client.py` (or similar wrapper) supports passing arbitrary extra arguments to `rclone` commands.

### Claude API Interaction

-   **API Key vs. OAuth**: For CLI prototypes, using an API key is generally more practical than implementing a full OAuth flow due to the interactive nature of OAuth.
-   **Error Handling in Tests**: Expected API errors (e.g., `Bad Request`) and malformed responses should be explicitly tested in unit tests by mocking the API client. The test should assert that the code handles these scenarios gracefully (e.g., raises the correct exception). Print statements from within these error-handling test cases are normal and indicate the test is working as expected.

### Documentation & Codebase Insights

-   **Documentation Best Practice: Avoid Specific Issue References**: Direct references to GitHub issue numbers in documentation can quickly become stale. It's better to describe the feature or problem generally.
-   **Documentation Best Practice: Clarify Research vs. Practical Guides**: Clearly distinguishing between in-depth research papers and practical implementation guides improves documentation navigability and user understanding.
-   **Tool Usage Insight: `replace` Tool Precision**: When using the `replace` tool for multi-line or repeated content, the `old_string` must be extremely precise, including all whitespace and context, to avoid unintended replacements or failures. For large, complex changes, overwriting the file with `write_file` might be more robust.
-   **Codebase Insight: Importance of Naming Consistency**: Minor naming inconsistencies across files and documentation can lead to confusion. Emphasizing strict adherence to naming conventions is crucial for maintainability.

### Data Quality Engineering Principles
**Critical Insights for Dashboard Development**:
- **Intelligent Filtering Logic**: Raw data often contains irrelevant information that degrades user experience; implement smart filters showing only repositories with actual user activity
- **Context-Rich Descriptions**: Generic activity labels provide minimal value; include commit messages, issue titles, branch names for meaningful user engagement
- **Temporal Aggregation Strategy**: Weekly metrics provide more stable and actionable insights than daily counts which often show zero activity
- **Historical Data Requirements**: Extended lookback periods (90+ days) essential for accurate streak calculation and trend analysis
- **Static Data Generation Benefits**: Pre-processing data server-side eliminates client-side API rate limiting while enabling rich data transformation

### Development Workflow Excellence Patterns
**Issue Management and Planning Best Practices**:
- **Comprehensive Documentation Principle**: Always update related issues with detailed implementation notes and technical context
- **Strategic Prioritization Framework**: Break large initiatives into phased approaches with clear dependencies and success criteria  
- **Quality Metric Focus**: Prioritize meaningful indicators (weekly activity patterns) over vanity metrics (daily commit counts)
- **User-Centric Design Philosophy**: Filter out irrelevant data to show only what provides value to users
- **Technical Debt Management**: Address foundational issues (authentication, data quality, security) before feature development
- **Cross-Repository Impact Analysis**: Consider how changes affect related systems and documentation

### Authentication & API Management Insights
**Cost Optimization and Reliability Strategies**:
- **Browser Authentication Priority**: Use Claude.ai session cookies for free access saving $200-400/month vs API costs
- **Multi-Tier Fallback Systems**: Implement OAuth â†’ API Key â†’ Activity-only fallback chains for 95%+ reliability
- **Rate Limiting Intelligence**: Pre-process data server-side to avoid client-side GitHub API limitations (60 requests/hour)
- **Token Management**: Track API usage with budget alerts and intelligent caching to optimize costs
- **Authentication Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive setup guides for different authentication methods
