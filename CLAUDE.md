## AI Enhancement System

### Authentication Methods (Priority Order)

#### 1. Browser-Based Authentication (FREE) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
**Cost**: $0/month (uses existing Claude.ai subscription)
**Implementation**: Real Chrome browser automation with session cookies
**Files**: `claude-browser-client.js`, `claude-browser-auth-manager.js`

**How it works:**
- Uses Puppeteer with stealth plugin to automate real Chrome browser
- Bypasses API costs by using Claude.ai web interface directly
- Requires valid Claude.ai session cookies from authenticated account
- Completely free - no token counting or API charges

**Setup Process:**
1. **Extract Cookies**: Export cookies from your logged-in Claude.ai session
2. **Configure Locally**: Create `.env` file with cookie values
3. **Save to GitHub**: Use `setup-claude-cookies.js` to save secrets
4. **Set Strategy**: `AUTH_STRATEGY=browser_first` in workflows

**Required Cookies:**
```bash
# Essential cookies (minimum required)
CLAUDE_SESSION_KEY=sk-ant-sid01-... # Primary authentication
CLAUDE_ORG_ID=your-org-uuid         # Organization identifier
CLAUDE_USER_ID=your-user-uuid       # User identifier

# Optional (improves reliability)
CLAUDE_CF_BM=cloudflare-token       # Bot management
CLAUDE_COOKIES_JSON='[...]'         # Full cookie array
```

**Test Browser Authentication:**
```bash
cd .github/scripts
node claude-browser-client.js test --visible  # Test with visible browser
node claude-browser-client.js test            # Test headless
node claude-browser-auth-manager.js status    # Check auth status
```

#### 2. Session-Based API Authentication (FREE, Limited)
**Cost**: $0/month (direct API calls with cookies)
**Status**: Currently blocked by Cloudflare protection
**Implementation**: Direct HTTP requests to Claude.ai API using session cookies
**File**: `claude-session-client.js`

**Note**: This method currently returns HTTP 403 due to Cloudflare bot protection. Browser automation is more reliable.

#### 3. OAuth Authentication (Subscription-based)
**Cost**: $100-200/month (Claude Max subscription)
**Usage**: 50-800 prompts per 5-hour window
**Implementation**: PKCE OAuth flow with Claude Max subscriptions
**Files**: `claude-oauth-client.js`, `claude-auth-manager.js`

#### 4. API Key Authentication (Pay-per-token)
**Cost**: $0.02-0.05 per request (variable pricing)
**Usage**: Pay-per-token model
**Implementation**: Direct Anthropic API calls
**Use Case**: Final fallback when other methods fail

### Token Management
- Budget tracking per creativity level (conservative: 15k, balanced: 25k, creative: 40k, innovative: 60k daily)
- Session limits to prevent overuse
- Intelligent caching to optimize API calls
- **Browser mode**: No token limits (uses web interface)

### Enhancement Strategy
- **Comprehensive**: Full analysis and optimization
- **Activity-only**: GitHub metrics only
- **AI-only**: Content optimization only
- **Emergency**: Minimal processing for urgent updates

## Frontend Features

### Modern Web Standards

## Development Notes

### When Making Changes
1. **Data Updates**: Modify `data/base-cv.json` for core CV information
2. **Styling**: Use CSS custom properties in `assets/styles.css` for consistency
3. **Functionality**: JavaScript in `assets/script.js` follows ES6+ standards
4. **Workflows**: Test changes to `.github/workflows/` files carefully as they run on schedule

### Testing Workflows Locally
```bash
# Test activity analysis
cd .github/scripts
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token node activity-analyzer.js

# Test AI enhancement (requires API key)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key node claude-enhancer.js

# Test CV generation
node cv-generator.js
```

### Common Tasks
- **Update CV content**: Edit `data/base-cv.json`
- **Modify styling**: Use CSS custom properties in `assets/styles.css`
- **Add new sections**: Update both data structure and HTML template
- **Adjust automation**: Modify workflow schedules or enhancement strategies
- **Update authentication**: Refresh cookies or change auth strategy

### Important Constraints
- All AI enhancements must respect token budgets (browser mode: unlimited)
- GitHub API calls are rate-limited, use caching appropriately
- Workflows commit changes automatically - avoid conflicts
- PDF generation requires headless browser capabilities in CI
- Browser authentication requires valid Claude.ai session cookies

## Browser Authentication Setup Guide

### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Export Cookies from Claude.ai**
   - Log into [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in your browser
   - Open Developer Tools (F12) → Application/Storage → Cookies
   - Find and copy these values:
     - `sessionKey` (starts with sk-ant-sid01-)
     - `lastActiveOrg` (UUID format)
     - `ajs_user_id` (UUID format)

2. **Create Local Environment File**
   ```bash
   cd .github/scripts
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your cookie values
   ```

3. **Test Authentication**
   ```bash
   node claude-browser-client.js test --visible
   ```

4. **Save to GitHub Secrets**
   ```bash
   node setup-claude-cookies.js
   # Follow prompts to save cookies to repository secrets
   ```

5. **Update Workflow Strategy**
   - Workflows are already configured for `browser_first` authentication
   - Next workflow run will automatically use browser authentication

### Advanced Cookie Export

For better reliability, export all cookies:
```javascript
// Run in browser console on claude.ai
JSON.stringify(document.cookie.split(';').map(c => {
  const [name, value] = c.trim().split('=');
  return { name, value, domain: '.claude.ai' };
}))
```

### Troubleshooting Browser Authentication

**Authentication Failed (403 Error)**:
- Cookies may be expired - re-export from fresh Claude.ai session
- Try using full `CLAUDE_COOKIES_JSON` instead of individual cookies
- Ensure Claude.ai account is active and accessible

**Browser Timeout**:
- Claude.ai may be slow - increase timeout in browser client
- Check headless vs visible mode for debugging

**CI/CD Issues**:
- Verify GitHub secrets are properly set
- Check workflow logs for browser launch errors
- Ensure `AUTH_STRATEGY=browser_first` is set

### Cost Analysis

**Traditional API Usage** (monthly estimates):
- Light usage (50 requests): ~$10-20
- Moderate usage (200 requests): ~$40-80
- Heavy usage (1000+ requests): ~$200-400

**Browser Authentication**:
- **All usage levels**: $0 (uses your existing Claude.ai subscription)
- **Savings**: 100% of Claude AI costs
- **Limitation**: Must maintain valid session cookies

This system maintains a living CV that evolves with professional development through intelligent automation while preserving full developer control over content and presentation.

## Critical System Insights

### Race Conditions & File Dependencies
- **Issue**: `activity-summary.json` can reference files before they're created, causing intermittent failures
- **Solution**: Always create referenced files atomically before updating summary files
- **Prevention**: Use `fs.mkdir()` with `{ recursive: true }` and verify file existence in workflows

### AI Content Processing
- **Issue**: AI-enhanced content often contains meta-commentary that shouldn't be displayed
- **Solution**: Implement content cleaning logic to extract only relevant enhanced content
- **Pattern**: Use regex to extract content between markers like `**Enhanced Summary:**` and `This enhancement:`

### CSS Variable Dependencies  
- **Issue**: Missing CSS variables cause styling failures that may go unnoticed
- **Solution**: Audit all CSS variables used and ensure they're defined in `:root`
- **Common**: `--color-primary-bg`, `--border-radius-sm` should be `--radius-sm`

### PDF Generation & Deployment
- **Issue**: PDF generated in `dist/` but not accessible in deployed `assets/`
- **Solution**: Ensure PDF is copied to correct location for public access
- **Workflow**: PDF generation happens in cv-generator.js automatically, don't add redundant steps

### Development Workflow Recommendations
- **Current Risk**: Direct commits to main branch affect production
- **Proposed**: Git Flow with `develop` branch, feature branches, and staging environment
- **Benefits**: Production safety, testing isolation, rollback capabilities

### Debugging Best Practices
1. Always verify file existence before referencing in workflows
2. Use comprehensive logging in critical workflow steps
3. Test CSS changes across multiple browsers and themes
4. Validate JSON structure after AI enhancement processes
5. Monitor workflow failures for race conditions and timeouts

## Recent System Improvements (July 2025)

## Session Recovery - August 2, 2025 - Data Architecture Corruption Fix

### Session Crash Recovery
**Issue**: Session completion commit accidentally restored oversized data files (10.3MB) instead of compressed versions (3.0MB).
**Impact**: CV loading failures, dashboard 404, repository bloat affecting CI performance.
**Root Cause**: Git hygiene failure - restored wrong file versions during documentation commit.

### Critical Fixes Applied
**Data Compression Restored**: Re-applied intelligent compression achieving 71.6% reduction (10.3MB → 3.0MB).
**Repository Cleaned**: Removed redundant files, restored enterprise-grade structure.
**File Structure Fixed**: Proper backup strategy with .original.json files maintained.

### Prevention Strategy Implemented
**Git Hygiene**: Always check `git status`, use selective `git add`, verify with `git diff`.
**Data Protection**: Keep compressed files as primary, originals as backups only.  
**Session Management**: Clean working directory before commits, separate functional from documentation commits.

## Session Recovery & Professional Git Flow - August 2, 2025 - Chaos Prevention

### Session Crash Recovery & UI Fixes
**Issues Resolved**: Navbar overlapping content, dev intelligence dashboard missing initialization, broken dashboard links.
**Technical Fixes**: Added proper CSS padding-top clearance, DevelopmentIntelligenceDashboard initialization, data architecture restoration.
**Deployment**: Successfully deployed all fixes to main branch, dashboards now functional.

### Chaotic Git Flow Lessons
**Problem**: Violated git flow - merged feature branch then continued working on it, created rebase conflicts, inconsistent branch states.
**Impact**: Feature branch showing "10 commits ahead, 21 behind main" - complete mess requiring manual cleanup.
**Root Cause**: No established workflow discipline, switching between approaches mid-session.

### Professional Workflow Established  
**Git Flow Guardrails**: Created comprehensive development workflow documentation preventing direct main commits.
**Session Discipline**: Pre-session checklists ensuring clean repository state, proper feature branch creation.
**Quality Gates**: Auto-merge for safe changes, manual review for complex features, branch protection with CI requirements.
**Prevention**: Emergency recovery procedures, atomic commits, clear session management protocols.

## Session Insights - August 2, 2025 - PR Review Automation & CI Recovery

### Claude OAuth PR Review System Implementation

**Review Automation**: Created `claude-pr-reviewer.js` with OAuth/browser authentication and `analyze-pr-failures.js` for immediate pattern-based analysis.
**Production Ready**: Complete PR review automation system deployed with GitHub comment integration and structured recommendations.

### Critical CI Issue Resolution  
**Root Cause Identified**: CV-staging links (404 errors) in CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, UAT_REVIEW_PROMPT.md causing markdown-link-check failures.
**Systematic Debugging**: Used GitHub CLI to analyze exact failure logs, located problematic files missing from local checkout.
**Resolution Applied**: Fixed all cv-staging → production URL references, triggered fresh CI runs for auto-merge validation.
