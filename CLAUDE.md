## AI Enhancement System

### Authentication Methods (Priority Order)

#### 1. Browser-Based Authentication (FREE) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
**Cost**: $0/month (uses existing Claude.ai subscription)
**Implementation**: Real Chrome browser automation with session cookies
**Files**: `claude-browser-client.js`, `claude-browser-auth-manager.js`

**How it works:**
- Uses Puppeteer with stealth plugin to automate real Chrome browser
- Bypasses API costs by using Claude.ai web interface directly
- Requires valid Claude.ai session cookies from authenticated account
- Completely free - no token counting or API charges

**Setup Process:**
1. **Extract Cookies**: Export cookies from your logged-in Claude.ai session
2. **Configure Locally**: Create `.env` file with cookie values
3. **Save to GitHub**: Use `setup-claude-cookies.js` to save secrets
4. **Set Strategy**: `AUTH_STRATEGY=browser_first` in workflows

**Required Cookies:**
```bash
# Essential cookies (minimum required)
CLAUDE_SESSION_KEY=sk-ant-sid01-... # Primary authentication
CLAUDE_ORG_ID=your-org-uuid         # Organization identifier
CLAUDE_USER_ID=your-user-uuid       # User identifier

# Optional (improves reliability)
CLAUDE_CF_BM=cloudflare-token       # Bot management
CLAUDE_COOKIES_JSON='[...]'         # Full cookie array
```

**Test Browser Authentication:**
```bash
cd .github/scripts
node claude-browser-client.js test --visible  # Test with visible browser
node claude-browser-client.js test            # Test headless
node claude-browser-auth-manager.js status    # Check auth status
```

#### 2. Session-Based API Authentication (FREE, Limited)
**Cost**: $0/month (direct API calls with cookies)
**Status**: Currently blocked by Cloudflare protection
**Implementation**: Direct HTTP requests to Claude.ai API using session cookies
**File**: `claude-session-client.js`

**Note**: This method currently returns HTTP 403 due to Cloudflare bot protection. Browser automation is more reliable.

#### 3. OAuth Authentication (Subscription-based)
**Cost**: $100-200/month (Claude Max subscription)
**Usage**: 50-800 prompts per 5-hour window
**Implementation**: PKCE OAuth flow with Claude Max subscriptions
**Files**: `claude-oauth-client.js`, `claude-auth-manager.js`

#### 4. API Key Authentication (Pay-per-token)
**Cost**: $0.02-0.05 per request (variable pricing)
**Usage**: Pay-per-token model
**Implementation**: Direct Anthropic API calls
**Use Case**: Final fallback when other methods fail

### Token Management
- Budget tracking per creativity level (conservative: 15k, balanced: 25k, creative: 40k, innovative: 60k daily)
- Session limits to prevent overuse
- Intelligent caching to optimize API calls
- **Browser mode**: No token limits (uses web interface)

### Enhancement Strategy
- **Comprehensive**: Full analysis and optimization
- **Activity-only**: GitHub metrics only
- **AI-only**: Content optimization only
- **Emergency**: Minimal processing for urgent updates

## Frontend Features

### Modern Web Standards
- Responsive CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- Progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript)
- Dark/light theme switching with localStorage persistence
- Smooth scroll navigation with URL hash management
- Structured data for SEO optimization

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for non-critical content
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Optimized font loading with preconnect

## Development Notes

### When Making Changes
1. **Data Updates**: Modify `data/base-cv.json` for core CV information
2. **Styling**: Use CSS custom properties in `assets/styles.css` for consistency
3. **Functionality**: JavaScript in `assets/script.js` follows ES6+ standards
4. **Workflows**: Test changes to `.github/workflows/` files carefully as they run on schedule

### Testing Workflows Locally
```bash
# Test activity analysis
cd .github/scripts
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token node activity-analyzer.js

# Test AI enhancement (requires API key)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key node claude-enhancer.js

# Test CV generation
node cv-generator.js
```

### Common Tasks
- **Update CV content**: Edit `data/base-cv.json`
- **Modify styling**: Use CSS custom properties in `assets/styles.css`
- **Add new sections**: Update both data structure and HTML template
- **Adjust automation**: Modify workflow schedules or enhancement strategies
- **Update authentication**: Refresh cookies or change auth strategy

### Important Constraints
- All AI enhancements must respect token budgets (browser mode: unlimited)
- GitHub API calls are rate-limited, use caching appropriately
- Workflows commit changes automatically - avoid conflicts
- PDF generation requires headless browser capabilities in CI
- Browser authentication requires valid Claude.ai session cookies

## Browser Authentication Setup Guide

### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Export Cookies from Claude.ai**
   - Log into [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in your browser
   - Open Developer Tools (F12) → Application/Storage → Cookies
   - Find and copy these values:
     - `sessionKey` (starts with sk-ant-sid01-)
     - `lastActiveOrg` (UUID format)
     - `ajs_user_id` (UUID format)

2. **Create Local Environment File**
   ```bash
   cd .github/scripts
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your cookie values
   ```

3. **Test Authentication**
   ```bash
   node claude-browser-client.js test --visible
   ```

4. **Save to GitHub Secrets**
   ```bash
   node setup-claude-cookies.js
   # Follow prompts to save cookies to repository secrets
   ```

5. **Update Workflow Strategy**
   - Workflows are already configured for `browser_first` authentication
   - Next workflow run will automatically use browser authentication

### Advanced Cookie Export

For better reliability, export all cookies:
```javascript
// Run in browser console on claude.ai
JSON.stringify(document.cookie.split(';').map(c => {
  const [name, value] = c.trim().split('=');
  return { name, value, domain: '.claude.ai' };
}))
```

### Troubleshooting Browser Authentication

**Authentication Failed (403 Error)**:
- Cookies may be expired - re-export from fresh Claude.ai session
- Try using full `CLAUDE_COOKIES_JSON` instead of individual cookies
- Ensure Claude.ai account is active and accessible

**Browser Timeout**:
- Claude.ai may be slow - increase timeout in browser client
- Check headless vs visible mode for debugging

**CI/CD Issues**:
- Verify GitHub secrets are properly set
- Check workflow logs for browser launch errors
- Ensure `AUTH_STRATEGY=browser_first` is set

### Cost Analysis

**Traditional API Usage** (monthly estimates):
- Light usage (50 requests): ~$10-20
- Moderate usage (200 requests): ~$40-80
- Heavy usage (1000+ requests): ~$200-400

**Browser Authentication**:
- **All usage levels**: $0 (uses your existing Claude.ai subscription)
- **Savings**: 100% of Claude AI costs
- **Limitation**: Must maintain valid session cookies

This system maintains a living CV that evolves with professional development through intelligent automation while preserving full developer control over content and presentation.

## Critical System Insights

### Race Conditions & File Dependencies
- **Issue**: `activity-summary.json` can reference files before they're created, causing intermittent failures
- **Solution**: Always create referenced files atomically before updating summary files
- **Prevention**: Use `fs.mkdir()` with `{ recursive: true }` and verify file existence in workflows

### AI Content Processing
- **Issue**: AI-enhanced content often contains meta-commentary that shouldn't be displayed
- **Solution**: Implement content cleaning logic to extract only relevant enhanced content
- **Pattern**: Use regex to extract content between markers like `**Enhanced Summary:**` and `This enhancement:`

### CSS Variable Dependencies  
- **Issue**: Missing CSS variables cause styling failures that may go unnoticed
- **Solution**: Audit all CSS variables used and ensure they're defined in `:root`
- **Common**: `--color-primary-bg`, `--border-radius-sm` should be `--radius-sm`

### PDF Generation & Deployment
- **Issue**: PDF generated in `dist/` but not accessible in deployed `assets/`
- **Solution**: Ensure PDF is copied to correct location for public access
- **Workflow**: PDF generation happens in cv-generator.js automatically, don't add redundant steps

### Development Workflow Recommendations
- **Current Risk**: Direct commits to main branch affect production
- **Proposed**: Git Flow with `develop` branch, feature branches, and staging environment
- **Benefits**: Production safety, testing isolation, rollback capabilities

### Debugging Best Practices
1. Always verify file existence before referencing in workflows
2. Use comprehensive logging in critical workflow steps
3. Test CSS changes across multiple browsers and themes
4. Validate JSON structure after AI enhancement processes
5. Monitor workflow failures for race conditions and timeouts

## Recent System Improvements (July 2025)

### Content Guardian & AI Hallucination Protection
**Critical System**: Implemented comprehensive protection against AI-generated fabricated content
- **Files**: `.github/scripts/content-guardian.js`, `data/protected-content.json`
- **Integration**: Built into enhancement orchestrator with pre/post validation
- **Protection**: All achievements marked as `protected: true, verified: true`
- **Audit Trail**: Content changes logged with violation detection
- **Usage**: `node content-guardian.js --validate` to check content integrity

### Activity Analyzer Fixes
**Issue Resolved**: Repository counting limited to 20 repos instead of full portfolio (191 total)
- **Problem**: `repos.slice(0, 20)` artificial limitation caused inaccurate metrics
- **Solution**: Implemented pagination with fork filtering for recently active repos only
- **Impact**: Now shows accurate commit counts across entire portfolio
- **Filter Logic**: Excludes forks unless recent commits detected (30-day window)

### Watch Me Work Dashboard Overhaul
**Major UX Improvements**: Fixed data accuracy and presentation issues
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Removes hardcoded repo list, auto-discovers active repositories
- **Fork Filtering**: Only shows forks with recent commit activity to reduce noise
- **Rich Context**: Replaced raw JSON displays with human-readable activity descriptions
- **Rate Limiting**: Added API call delays to prevent GitHub throttling
- **Activity Details**: Enhanced modals with commit lists, issue context, release notes

### Position Description Ingester (New Component)
**Job Targeting System**: Analyze job descriptions for CV customization
- **File**: `.github/scripts/position-description-ingester.js`
- **Capabilities**: Extract skills, requirements, company culture from job postings
- **Analysis**: Generate skill match percentages and enhancement recommendations
- **Usage**: `node position-description-ingester.js --text "job description"`
- **Output**: Targeting insights saved to `data/targeting/` for CV customization

### CI Pipeline Dependencies
**Critical Configuration**: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required for automation
- **Issue**: CV Enhancement Pipeline fails without API key secret
- **Location**: GitHub repository secrets must include `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/cv-enhancement.yml` expects this secret
- **Fallback**: System gracefully handles missing API key with activity-only mode

### Enhanced Authentication & Career Narrative
**Content Authenticity**: Replaced fabricated achievements with verified career history
- **Real Experience**: Systems Analyst at Homes Tasmania, environmental advocacy background
- **Neurodivergent Path**: Authentic career narrative celebrates diverse journey as strength

## Session Insights - August 1, 2025

### Critical Bug Fixes & API Evolution
**Fixed Claude API System Role Error**: The Claude API no longer accepts "system" as a message role. System messages must be passed as a top-level parameter:
```javascript
// Extract system message and pass at top level
if (messages[0]?.role === 'system') {
    requestOptions.system = messages[0].content;
    requestOptions.messages = messages.slice(1);
}
```
