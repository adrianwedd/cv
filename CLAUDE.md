# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-Enhanced CV System that automatically generates and maintains a professional CV website using GitHub activity analysis and Claude AI content optimization. The system runs on GitHub Actions with scheduled workflows for continuous enhancement.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JS website with responsive design (`index.html`, `assets/`)
- **Data Layer**: JSON-based CV data structure (`data/base-cv.json`)
- **Automation Layer**: GitHub Actions workflows for AI enhancement (`.github/workflows/`)
- **Processing Scripts**: Node.js scripts for activity analysis and AI enhancement (`.github/scripts/`)

### Key Files
- `data/base-cv.json` - Core CV data structure (personal info, experience, projects, skills)
- `index.html` - Main CV webpage with structured data and responsive design
- `assets/styles.css` - Modern CSS with design tokens and responsive layouts
- `assets/script.js` - Interactive features, theme switching, and dynamic content loading
- `.github/workflows/cv-enhancement.yml` - Main automation pipeline (runs every 6 hours)

## Development Commands

### GitHub Scripts
```bash
# Navigate to scripts directory
cd .github/scripts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run individual components
node activity-analyzer.js    # Analyze GitHub activity
node claude-enhancer.js      # AI content enhancement
node cv-generator.js         # Generate CV website

# Run tests
npm test                     # Run all tests
npm run lint                 # ESLint validation
```

### Debugging & Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check data file consistency (after activity analysis)
find data/ -name "github-activity-*" | head -3
find data/ -name "professional-development-*" | head -3
find data/ -name "activity-trends-*" | head -3

# Verify PDF generation
ls -la dist/assets/adrian-wedd-cv.pdf
file dist/assets/adrian-wedd-cv.pdf

# Test data file references
node -e "const s=require('./data/activity-summary.json'); console.log('Files:', s.data_files);"
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Serve locally (use any static server)
python -m http.server 8000
# OR
npx serve .
```

### Validation
```bash
# Validate JSON data files
for file in data/*.json; do jq . "$file" > /dev/null && echo "âœ… $file valid"; done

# Check workflow syntax
cd .github/scripts && npm run lint
```

## Workflow Architecture

### CV Enhancement Pipeline (`cv-enhancement.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Every 6 hours via cron schedule
- **Steps**:
  1. Intelligence Analysis - determines enhancement strategy based on activity
  2. GitHub Activity Collection - analyzes commits, repos, languages
  3. Claude AI Enhancement - optimizes content using AI
  4. Professional Metrics Calculation - scores and analytics
  5. Dynamic Website Generation - builds responsive CV site
  6. GitHub Pages Deployment - publishes live site

### Key Environment Variables
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude AI API access
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub API access for activity analysis
- `TIMEZONE` - Set to "Australia/Tasmania"

## Data Structure

### base-cv.json Schema
```json
{
  "metadata": { "version", "last_updated", "enhancement_ready" },
  "personal_info": { "name", "title", "location", "contact_info" },
  "professional_summary": "string",
  "experience": [{ "position", "company", "period", "achievements", "technologies" }],
  "projects": [{ "name", "description", "technologies", "metrics", "github" }],
  "skills": [{ "name", "category", "level", "proficiency", "experience_years" }],
  "achievements": [{ "title", "description", "date", "metrics" }],
  "education": [{ "degree", "institution", "key_areas" }]
}
```

## AI Enhancement System

### Token Management
- Budget tracking per creativity level (conservative: 15k, balanced: 25k, creative: 40k, innovative: 60k daily)
- Session limits to prevent overuse
- Intelligent caching to optimize API calls

### Enhancement Strategy
- **Comprehensive**: Full analysis and optimization
- **Activity-only**: GitHub metrics only
- **AI-only**: Content optimization only
- **Emergency**: Minimal processing for urgent updates

## Frontend Features

### Modern Web Standards
- Responsive CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- Progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript)
- Dark/light theme switching with localStorage persistence
- Smooth scroll navigation with URL hash management
- Structured data for SEO optimization

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for non-critical content
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Optimized font loading with preconnect

## Development Notes

### When Making Changes
1. **Data Updates**: Modify `data/base-cv.json` for core CV information
2. **Styling**: Use CSS custom properties in `assets/styles.css` for consistency
3. **Functionality**: JavaScript in `assets/script.js` follows ES6+ standards
4. **Workflows**: Test changes to `.github/workflows/` files carefully as they run on schedule

### Testing Workflows Locally
```bash
# Test activity analysis
cd .github/scripts
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token node activity-analyzer.js

# Test AI enhancement (requires API key)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key node claude-enhancer.js

# Test CV generation
node cv-generator.js
```

### Common Tasks
- **Update CV content**: Edit `data/base-cv.json`
- **Modify styling**: Use CSS custom properties in `assets/styles.css`
- **Add new sections**: Update both data structure and HTML template
- **Adjust automation**: Modify workflow schedules or enhancement strategies

### Important Constraints
- All AI enhancements must respect token budgets
- GitHub API calls are rate-limited, use caching appropriately
- Workflows commit changes automatically - avoid conflicts
- PDF generation requires headless browser capabilities in CI

This system maintains a living CV that evolves with professional development through intelligent automation while preserving full developer control over content and presentation.

## Critical System Insights

### Race Conditions & File Dependencies
- **Issue**: `activity-summary.json` can reference files before they're created, causing intermittent failures
- **Solution**: Always create referenced files atomically before updating summary files
- **Prevention**: Use `fs.mkdir()` with `{ recursive: true }` and verify file existence in workflows

### AI Content Processing
- **Issue**: AI-enhanced content often contains meta-commentary that shouldn't be displayed
- **Solution**: Implement content cleaning logic to extract only relevant enhanced content
- **Pattern**: Use regex to extract content between markers like `**Enhanced Summary:**` and `This enhancement:`

### CSS Variable Dependencies  
- **Issue**: Missing CSS variables cause styling failures that may go unnoticed
- **Solution**: Audit all CSS variables used and ensure they're defined in `:root`
- **Common**: `--color-primary-bg`, `--border-radius-sm` should be `--radius-sm`

### PDF Generation & Deployment
- **Issue**: PDF generated in `dist/` but not accessible in deployed `assets/`
- **Solution**: Ensure PDF is copied to correct location for public access
- **Workflow**: PDF generation happens in cv-generator.js automatically, don't add redundant steps

### Development Workflow Recommendations
- **Current Risk**: Direct commits to main branch affect production
- **Proposed**: Git Flow with `develop` branch, feature branches, and staging environment
- **Benefits**: Production safety, testing isolation, rollback capabilities

### Debugging Best Practices
1. Always verify file existence before referencing in workflows
2. Use comprehensive logging in critical workflow steps
3. Test CSS changes across multiple browsers and themes
4. Validate JSON structure after AI enhancement processes
5. Monitor workflow failures for race conditions and timeouts

## Recent System Improvements (July 2025)

### Content Guardian & AI Hallucination Protection
**Critical System**: Implemented comprehensive protection against AI-generated fabricated content
- **Files**: `.github/scripts/content-guardian.js`, `data/protected-content.json`
- **Integration**: Built into enhancement orchestrator with pre/post validation
- **Protection**: All achievements marked as `protected: true, verified: true`
- **Audit Trail**: Content changes logged with violation detection
- **Usage**: `node content-guardian.js --validate` to check content integrity

### Activity Analyzer Fixes
**Issue Resolved**: Repository counting limited to 20 repos instead of full portfolio (191 total)
- **Problem**: `repos.slice(0, 20)` artificial limitation caused inaccurate metrics
- **Solution**: Implemented pagination with fork filtering for recently active repos only
- **Impact**: Now shows accurate commit counts across entire portfolio
- **Filter Logic**: Excludes forks unless recent commits detected (30-day window)

### Watch Me Work Dashboard Overhaul
**Major UX Improvements**: Fixed data accuracy and presentation issues
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Removes hardcoded repo list, auto-discovers active repositories
- **Fork Filtering**: Only shows forks with recent commit activity to reduce noise
- **Rich Context**: Replaced raw JSON displays with human-readable activity descriptions
- **Rate Limiting**: Added API call delays to prevent GitHub throttling
- **Activity Details**: Enhanced modals with commit lists, issue context, release notes

### Position Description Ingester (New Component)
**Job Targeting System**: Analyze job descriptions for CV customization
- **File**: `.github/scripts/position-description-ingester.js`
- **Capabilities**: Extract skills, requirements, company culture from job postings
- **Analysis**: Generate skill match percentages and enhancement recommendations
- **Usage**: `node position-description-ingester.js --text "job description"`
- **Output**: Targeting insights saved to `data/targeting/` for CV customization

### CI Pipeline Dependencies
**Critical Configuration**: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required for automation
- **Issue**: CV Enhancement Pipeline fails without API key secret
- **Location**: GitHub repository secrets must include `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/cv-enhancement.yml` expects this secret
- **Fallback**: System gracefully handles missing API key with activity-only mode

### Enhanced Authentication & Career Narrative
**Content Authenticity**: Replaced fabricated achievements with verified career history
- **Real Experience**: Systems Analyst at Homes Tasmania, environmental advocacy background
- **Neurodivergent Path**: Authentic career narrative celebrates diverse journey as strength
- **Technical Depth**: API integration, cybersecurity leadership, AI implementation pioneer
- **Social Impact**: Technology work combined with environmental and social causes
