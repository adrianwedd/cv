## Quality Validation Examples

### High-Quality Enhancement Characteristics
- **Specific Technical Indicators**: "2,847+ commits", "17 active repositories", "Python, JavaScript, Java"
- **Evidence-Based Claims**: Every claim traceable to activity data or experience
- **Avoid Generic Language**: No "cutting-edge", "seamlessly", "innovative solutions"
- **Market Positioning**: Clear target roles and competitive advantages
- **Balanced Confidence**: Claims proportional to evidence strength

### Low-Quality Enhancement Red Flags
- **Unsupported Superlatives**: "World-class expert", "Revolutionary innovator"
- **Generic Technology Lists**: "Familiar with: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript..."
- **Vague Impact Claims**: "Significantly improved performance"
- **Missing Evidence**: Claims without GitHub or experience backing
- **Length Violations**: More than 3 sentences or under 100 characters

## Template Validation Checklist

### Required Elements
- [ ] 2-3 sentence structure (100-500 characters)
