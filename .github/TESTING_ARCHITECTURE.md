# üèóÔ∏è Enterprise Testing Architecture

## Design Principles

### Zero Tolerance Standards
- **No Flaky Tests**: Every test must pass 3 consecutive times before activation
- **Bulletproof Dependencies**: Dedicated server management with proper lifecycle
- **Intelligent Recovery**: Exponential backoff and comprehensive error handling
- **Foundation First**: Rock-solid basic infrastructure before advanced features

### Dual Testing Strategy

#### Foundation Layer: Node.js Native Tests (`.github/scripts`)
- **Purpose**: Core functionality, API integrations, business logic
- **Technology**: Node.js `--test` runner (fastest, most reliable)
- **Location**: `.github/scripts/*.test.js`
- **Coverage**: Core CV generation, AI enhancement, activity analysis

#### Advanced Layer: Browser-Based Tests (`tests/`)
- **Purpose**: UI, accessibility, performance, cross-browser validation
- **Technology**: Jest + Puppeteer + Playwright (comprehensive but complex)
- **Location**: `tests/**/*.test.js`
- **Coverage**: WCAG compliance, Core Web Vitals, responsive design

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Bulletproofing
1. Fix Node.js test runner configuration and coverage
2. Ensure all core tests pass consistently
3. Implement proper error handling and timeouts

### Phase 2: Browser Test Stabilization  
1. Resolve Jest configuration conflicts
2. Implement dedicated server management
3. Add comprehensive retry logic and cleanup

### Phase 3: Systematic Activation
1. Enable test suites one by one with validation
2. Require 3 consecutive successful runs per suite
3. Full pipeline integration testing

## Success Criteria
- 10 consecutive successful full pipeline runs
- Sub-3-minute total execution time
- 95%+ reliability across all environments
- Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
