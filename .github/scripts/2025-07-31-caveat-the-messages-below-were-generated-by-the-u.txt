⏺ Read(claude-enhancer.js)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me create a comprehensive plan based on the issues and CI logs analysis:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Fix LLM meta-commentary artifacts in About Me section by refining prompts in claude-enhancer.js
     ☐ Fix implausible net lines contributed calculation in activity-analyzer.js
     ☐ Replace placeholder metrics with verified GitHub data across CV generation
     ☐ Investigate and fix CV Auto-Enhancement Pipeline failure from latest run
     ☐ Implement XML tag structuring and few-shot prompting (issues #97, #96)
     ☐ Complete 'Watch Me Work' Live Activity Dashboard implementation (issue #99)

⏺ High-Value Task Plan

  Based on my analysis of GitHub issues and CI logs, here's the prioritized plan focusing on critical system stability and
  data integrity:

  Phase 1: Critical Fixes (P1 Issues)

  1. Fix CV Auto-Enhancement Pipeline Failure - The latest scheduled run failed, breaking the core automation
  2. Fix LLM Meta-Commentary Bug (Issue #100) - AI output contains unwanted explanations, degrading CV quality
  3. Fix Data Integrity Issues (Issue #80) - Implausible net lines calculation corrupting activity metrics
  4. Replace Placeholder Metrics (Issue #81) - Ensure all CV data comes from verified GitHub sources

  Phase 2: System Improvements (High-Impact)

  5. Modernize Prompt Engineering (Issues #97, #96) - Implement XML structuring and few-shot prompting for better AI output
  6. Complete Watch Me Work Dashboard (Issue #99) - Live activity visualization for transparency

  Immediate Impact Analysis:

  - 4 P1 High priority issues causing data integrity and automation failures
  - Failed CI pipeline breaking the 6-hour enhancement cycle
  - Activity tracking system producing invalid metrics (82.50/100 activity score but corrupted data)
  - AI enhancement generating unprofessional output with meta-commentary

  The plan prioritizes system stability first (fix the broken pipeline), then data quality (fix corrupted metrics), and
  finally enhancement features (better prompting and visualization).

  Would you like me to start with the most critical issue - investigating and fixing the failed CV Auto-Enhancement
  Pipeline?

> proceed. commit and push and update your issues as you go please. work as 10x-dev-architect if it helps.

⏺ I'll proceed with the plan and use the 10x-dev-architect agent to systematically tackle these critical issues. Let me
  start by investigating the failed CV Auto-Enhancement Pipeline and then work through the high-priority fixes.

⏺ 10x-dev-architect(Fix critical CI pipeline failure)
  ⎿  Done (44 tool uses · 82.3k tokens · 8m 27.0s)                                                                         

⏺ Excellent! The critical pipeline failure has been fixed. Now let me update the todo and move on to the next critical
  issue - the LLM meta-commentary bug.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Investigate and fix CV Auto-Enhancement Pipeline failure from latest run
