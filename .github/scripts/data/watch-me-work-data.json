This significantly advances the unstructured document ingestion pipeline.\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n-   **Dependencies Installed:** `pdfminer.six` (for PDF) and `python-docx` (for DOCX) have been installed and are now used for text extraction.\n-   **`temp/process_cv_documents.py` Updated:** The script now utilizes these libraries to extract text directly from the respective file types.\n-   **End-to-End Test:** The entire pipeline, from real text extraction to Claude API parsing, has been successfully tested on the six sample documents. The structured JSON outputs are saved in `temp/parsed_cv_outputs/`.\n-   **`src/python/requirements.txt` Created:** A `requirements.txt` file has been added to `src/python/` to document the Python dependencies.\n\nThis completes the core functionality for unstructured document ingestion. The extracted text is now reliably fed into the Claude-powered `CVParser`.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nFurther work on this issue could involve:\n-   Refining the Claude prompt for even more accurate and comprehensive extraction.\n-   Implementing error handling for malformed documents that cannot be parsed by the extraction libraries.\n-   Integrating this pipeline into a broader workflow for automated ingestion.",

The parsed JSON outputs have been saved to `temp/parsed_cv_outputs/`.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n-   **PDF Files (`Adrian Wedd Current CV.pdf`, `Adrian Wedd CV.pdf`):** Text was simulated using the previously obtained OCR output. The `CVParser` successfully extracted structured data (name, contact, summary, experience, etc.) from this simulated text, demonstrating the parser's ability to process realistic CV content.\n-   **DOCX Files (`Adrian Wedd CV.docx`, `Adrian Wedd CV(1).docx`, `Adrian Wedd CV(2).docx`):** Text was simulated using a generic placeholder. The parser produced structured output based on this placeholder, confirming its general functionality.\n-   **TXT File (`Adrian_Wedd_CV.txt`):** The content was read directly from the file. The `CVParser` successfully extracted structured data from this plain text CV.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nThis successful test validates the core LLM-driven parsing logic. The next critical step for the unstructured document ingestion pipeline is to implement robust text extraction from actual PDF and DOCX files. This will involve integrating appropriate Python libraries (e.g., `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`) to convert these binary formats into plain text, which can then be fed into the `CVParser` for structured data extraction.",

This brings the unstructured document ingestion prototype closer to a functional state.\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n-   **`cv_parser.py`:**\n    -   Removed the mock response logic.\n    -   Implemented actual `requests` calls to the Claude API (`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`).\n    -   The `_call_llm_for_parsing` method now constructs an XML prompt (as previously defined conceptually) and sends it to Claude.\n    -   Includes logic to extract the JSON object from Claude's response (assuming it's wrapped in `<json>` tags).\n    -   Incorporates robust error handling for API request failures and JSON decoding issues.\n    -   Requires `CLAUDE_API_KEY` to be set as an environment variable for authentication.\n-   **`test_cv_parser.py`:**\n    -   Updated to use `unittest.mock.patch` to simulate `requests.post` calls, ensuring tests remain isolated and do not make live API requests.\n    -   Includes test cases for successful API calls, API errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request), and scenarios where Claude's response does not contain the expected JSON.\n\nThis completes a major milestone for the unstructured document ingestion pipeline. The next steps will involve implementing text extraction from various document formats (PDF, DOCX) and then feeding that extracted text into this Claude-powered parser.",

          "body": "### Progress Update: LLM-Driven CV Parsing Prototype Implemented\n\nI have successfully implemented a prototype for LLM-driven CV parsing within `src/python/document_parsing/cv_parser.py`. This prototype demonstrates how unstructured CV text can be transformed into a structured JSON format by leveraging the capabilities of a large language model (LLM).\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n-   **`cv_parser.py`:** Refactored to include a `parse_cv` method that simulates an LLM call for parsing.\n-   **Conceptual XML Prompt:** A conceptual XML prompt structure is defined within the code, illustrating how raw CV text would be presented to an LLM (like Claude) for extraction, aligning with the project's existing prompt engineering framework.\n-   **Mock LLM Response:** For prototyping purposes, the `_call_llm_for_parsing` method returns a hardcoded structured JSON response, mimicking a successful LLM extraction.\n-   **Unit Tests:** `test_cv_parser.py` has been updated to validate the output of this new LLM-driven parsing logic, ensuring the structured data matches expectations.\n\nThis marks a significant step towards implementing the unstructured document ingestion pipeline, focusing on the strengths of LLMs for data transformation. The next steps will involve integrating actual LLM API calls and handling various document formats (PDF, DOCX) for text extraction prior to LLM processing.",

          "body": "### Problem Statement\n\nThe current CV generation pipeline primarily relies on pre-structured JSON data. To enhance the system's capabilities and leverage a wider range of historical and external data, there is a need to implement a robust pipeline for ingesting and parsing unstructured documents such as:\n\n-   **Historical CVs/Resumes:** In various formats (PDF, DOCX, plain text).\n-   **Job Applications:** Submitted by the user.\n-   **Position Descriptions:** From previous jobs or target roles.\n\nThis unstructured data contains valuable information (skills, experience, responsibilities, requirements) that needs to be extracted and converted into a structured format compatible with our existing data models.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nDevelop a multi-stage ingestion and parsing pipeline:\n\n1.  **Document Conversion/Text Extraction:** Implement modules to convert various document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.) into clean, extractable plain text. Libraries like `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`, or similar will be explored.\n2.  **Information Extraction (NLP/Rule-Based):** Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and/or rule-based parsing to identify and extract key entities and relationships from the extracted text. This includes:\n    *   Personal information (name, contact).\n    *   Skills and technologies.\n    *   Work experience (company, title, dates, responsibilities).\n    *   Education.\n    *   Achievements and quantifiable results.\n    *   Job requirements from position descriptions.\n3.  **Data Structuring and Mapping:** Transform the extracted information into a standardized JSON format that aligns with the existing CV data schema.\n4.  **Error Handling and Validation:** Implement robust error handling for parsing failures and validation mechanisms to ensure data quality.\n\n### Initial Test Data\n\nThe files located in `temp/rclone_downloads/` will serve as initial test data for developing and validating this ingestion pipeline.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n-   A dedicated Python module (e.g., `src/python/document_parser.py` or similar) is created for document parsing.\n-   The pipeline successfully extracts key information from sample PDF and DOCX CVs/job descriptions into a structured format.\n-   The extracted data can be successfully integrated into the existing CV data model.\n-   Robust error handling is in place for malformed or unparseable documents.\n-   Unit tests are developed for the parsing and extraction logic.\n\n### Priority\n\nP1: High (This is foundational for leveraging new data sources and enhancing AI capabilities.)",

This aims to replace generic assumptions with actual career history, leading to more authentic and accurate AI-generated content.\n\n**Current Implementation:**\nThere is currently no implementation for historical career document analysis.\n*   **`rclone` Integration:** The project does not currently utilize `rclone` or any other cloud storage integration for document discovery and retrieval. The `rclone` commands mentioned in the issue body are conceptual and not integrated into any workflow or script.\n*   **Document Processing:** There are no existing modules or scripts for:\n    *   PDF/DOC text extraction.\n    *   Career timeline reconstruction from unstructured text.\n    *   Skills evolution tracking.\n    *   Achievement pattern analysis from historical documents.\n    The `cv-generator.js` and `claude-enhancer.js` primarily operate on pre-structured JSON data (`base-cv.json`, `activity-summary.json`, `ai-enhancements.json`).\n*   **Contextual AI Enhancement:** The `claude-enhancer.js` does not have a mechanism to load or leverage historical career documents for factual grounding, consistency validation, or to reflect authentic career development trajectories.\n\n**Proposed Implementation Strategy:**\n\n#### Phase 1: Document Discovery & Retrieval\n*   **Tool**: `rclone` (or similar cloud storage synchronization tool).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   Configure `rclone` to access specified cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).\n    *   Implement scripts to search for and selectively retrieve historical career documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) to a local, untracked temporary directory.\n\n#### Phase 2: Document Analysis Pipeline\n*   **Components**: New scripts/modules (e.g., Python-based for robust text extraction and NLP).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   **Text Extraction**: Convert various document formats (PDF, DOCX) into analyzable plain text.\n    *   **Career Timeline Reconstruction**: Extract dates, roles, and responsibilities to build a chronological career timeline.\n    *   **Skills Evolution Tracking**: Identify and track the development and usage of skills over time.\n    *   **Achievement Pattern Analysis**: Analyze historical documents to quantify career progression and identify key achievements.\n\n#### Phase 3: Contextual AI Enhancement\n*   **Integration Point**: `claude-enhancer.js` (before AI processing).\n*   **Capabilities**:\n    *   **Factual Grounding**: Use the extracted historical career data to fact-check and ground AI-generated content, ensuring authenticity.\n    *   **Consistency Validation**: Validate that enhanced content aligns with historical facts and career progression.\n    *   **Hallucination Detection**: Flag AI outputs that contradict documented historical facts.\n\n**Expected Benefits:**\n*   **Authenticity**: Significantly improved factual accuracy and authenticity of AI-generated content.\n*   **Contextual Relevance**: Enhanced AI understanding of the user's actual career trajectory.\n*   **Consistency**: Elimination of contradictory information across documents.\n*   **Personalization**: Truly personalized enhancement based on real career data.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n*   **Document Processing Engine**: A new component (e.g., `HistoricalCareerAnalyzer` as suggested in the original issue) responsible for parsing and extracting structured data from historical documents.\n*   **Integration with Enhancement Pipeline**: The extracted historical context will be loaded and provided to the `claude-enhancer.js` before AI processing.\n\n**Potential Progress:**\nNo progress has been made on this issue. The functionality needs to be implemented from scratch.\n\n**Priority:** This is a high-value enhancement that transforms the system from generic AI enhancement to authentic career development based on real professional history. It is currently **P2: Medium**, which is appropriate.",

This will significantly improve search efficiency.\n\n**Refined Plan:**\n\n1.  **Targeted Search:** Utilize `rclone lsf` to search *only* within the provided Google Drive folder ID for files matching keywords like `application`, `cv`, `curriculum vitae` (case-insensitive, filename/path only).\n2.  **Preview Results:** The script will first list the identified files for review, without copying them.\n3.  **Conditional Copy:** Upon user confirmation, the identified files (including Google Docs, which will be exported as PDF/DOCX during copy) will be copied to the local `temp/rclone_downloads` directory.\n\nThis approach addresses concerns about large data volumes and provides better control over the discovery process.",

This aims to replace generic assumptions with actual career history, leading to more authentic and accurate AI-generated content.\n\n**Current Implementation:**\nThere is currently no implementation for historical career document analysis.\n*   **`rclone` Integration:** The project does not currently utilize `rclone` or any other cloud storage integration for document discovery and retrieval. The `rclone` commands mentioned in the issue body are conceptual and not integrated into any workflow or script.\n*   **Document Processing:** There are no existing modules or scripts for:\n    *   PDF/DOC text extraction.\n    *   Career timeline reconstruction from unstructured text.\n    *   Skills evolution tracking.\n    *   Achievement pattern analysis from historical documents.\n    The `cv-generator.js` and `claude-enhancer.js` primarily operate on pre-structured JSON data (`base-cv.json`, `activity-summary.json`, `ai-enhancements.json`).\n*   **Contextual AI Enhancement:** The `claude-enhancer.js` does not have a mechanism to load or leverage historical career documents for factual grounding, consistency validation, or to reflect authentic career development trajectories.\n\n**Proposed Implementation Strategy:**\n\n#### Phase 1: Document Discovery & Retrieval\n*   **Tool**: `rclone` (or similar cloud storage synchronization tool).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   Configure `rclone` to access specified cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).\n    *   Implement scripts to search for and selectively retrieve historical career documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) to a local, untracked temporary directory.\n\n#### Phase 2: Document Analysis Pipeline\n*   **Components**: New scripts/modules (e.g., Python-based for robust text extraction and NLP).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   **Text Extraction**: Convert various document formats (PDF, DOCX) into analyzable plain text.\n    *   **Career Timeline Reconstruction**: Extract dates, roles, and responsibilities to build a chronological career timeline.\n    *   **Skills Evolution Tracking**: Identify and track the development and usage of skills over time.\n    *   **Achievement Pattern Analysis**: Analyze historical documents to quantify career progression and identify key achievements.\n\n#### Phase 3: Contextual AI Enhancement\n*   **Integration Point**: `claude-enhancer.js` (before AI processing).\n*   **Capabilities**:\n    *   **Factual Grounding**: Use the extracted historical career data to fact-check and ground AI-generated content, ensuring authenticity.\n    *   **Consistency Validation**: Validate that enhanced content aligns with historical facts and career progression.\n    *   **Hallucination Detection**: Flag AI outputs that contradict documented historical facts.\n\n**Expected Benefits:**\n*   **Authenticity**: Significantly improved factual accuracy and authenticity of AI-generated content.\n*   **Contextual Relevance**: Enhanced AI understanding of the user's actual career trajectory.\n*   **Consistency**: Elimination of contradictory information across documents.\n*   **Personalization**: Truly personalized enhancement based on real career data.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n*   **Document Processing Engine**: A new component (e.g., `HistoricalCareerAnalyzer` as suggested in the original issue) responsible for parsing and extracting structured data from historical documents.\n*   **Integration with Enhancement Pipeline**: The extracted historical context will be loaded and provided to the `claude-enhancer.js` before AI processing.\n\n**Potential Progress:**\nNo progress has been made on this issue. The functionality needs to be implemented from scratch.\n\n**Priority:** This is a high-value enhancement that transforms the system from generic AI enhancement to authentic career development based on real professional history. It is currently **P2: Medium**, which is appropriate.",

          "body": "### Progress Update: Phase 1 - Document Discovery & Retrieval (rclone integration)\n\nI have successfully implemented the `rclone_client.py` module within `src/python/cloud_storage/`. This module provides core functionalities for interacting with `rclone` via `subprocess`.\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n-   **`rclone_client.py`:** Developed a Python client to execute `rclone` commands.\n-   **`lsf` function:** Implemented functionality to list files and directories on a remote cloud storage.\n-   **`copy` function:** Implemented functionality to copy files from a remote to a local path.\n-   **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests have been added for `rclone_client.py`, ensuring its reliability and proper interaction with `subprocess`.\n\nThis completes the initial development for Phase 1 of this issue. The next steps will involve integrating this client into a broader document discovery and retrieval workflow.\n",

          "body": "## Summary\nImplement a proper testing framework for the music sorter script to ensure reliability and catch regressions during development.\n\n## Background\nFrom `CLAUDE.md`:\n> **Testing:** No formal test framework is currently implemented. Testing should be done with:\n> 1. Dry-run mode first (`./music_sorter.sh`)\n> 2. Small test directories before processing large collections\n> 3. Review log files in detail before using `--move` flag\n\nThis manual testing approach needs to be supplemented with automated tests.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Test Framework Setup\n- **Bash testing framework**: Consider `bats-core` (Bash Automated Testing System)\n- **Test directory structure**: Organized test cases with sample music files\n- **CI Integration**: Ensure tests run automatically on commits/PRs\n\n### Test Categories Needed\n\n#### 1. **Unit Tests**\n- `sanitize_filename()`: Test filename sanitization with various problematic characters\n- `check_dependencies()`: Mock missing dependencies\n- `get_log_level_name()`: Test all log level mappings\n- Metadata parsing functions\n\n#### 2. **Integration Tests**  \n- **Album processing**: Test complete album analysis workflow\n- **Quality detection**: Test Lossless/Lossy/Mixed classification\n- **Path generation**: Test target directory structure creation\n- **Error handling**: Test problematic albums (missing metadata, etc.)\n\n#### 3. **End-to-End Tests**\n- **Dry-run mode**: Verify no actual file changes occur\n- **Complete workflow**: Source → Analysis → Target path planning\n- **Configuration loading**: Test config file parsing and CLI overrides\n- **Logging**: Verify log file content and format\n\n#### 4. **Edge Case Tests**\n- **Various Artists** compilations\n- **Multi-disc albums** \n- **Special characters** in metadata (Unicode, symbols)\n- **Missing/inconsistent metadata**\n- **Mixed file formats** within albums\n- **Empty directories**\n- **Symbolic links**\n\n### Test Data Requirements\nCreate test music collection with:\n- Sample albums with good metadata\n- Albums with missing/bad metadata  \n- Multi-disc albums\n- Various Artists compilations\n- Mixed quality albums (FLAC + MP3)\n- Files with problematic characters in names/metadata\n\n## Implementation Plan\n1. **Choose testing framework** (recommend `bats-core`)\n2. **Create `tests/` directory** structure\n3. **Generate test music files** (or use Creative Commons samples)\n4. **Write test cases** for each component\n5. **Add CI workflow** (GitHub Actions)\n6. **Document testing process** in README\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Automated test framework is set up and functional\n- [ ] Unit tests cover all core functions\n- [ ] Integration tests verify album processing workflow\n- [ ] End-to-end tests validate complete dry-run operations\n- [ ] Edge cases are properly tested\n- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline\n- [ ] Test coverage report is available\n- [ ] Documentation explains how to run tests\n\n## Benefits\n- **Catch regressions** during development\n- **Validate fixes** before deployment\n- **Document expected behavior** through test cases\n- **Enable confident refactoring**\n- **Ensure cross-platform compatibility**\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)",

A warning will be logged.\n\n## Current State\nThe specifications mention conflict resolution but it's not implemented. The script will need to handle cases where organized music already exists.\n\n## Requirements\nImplement conflict resolution logic that:\n\n1. **Check for existing paths**: Before moving, verify if target directory/files exist\n2. **Identical content detection**: Compare files to determine if they're the same\n3. **Naming conflict resolution**: \n   - Append `_1`, `_2`, etc. to album directory names\n   - Handle both directory and file name conflicts\n4. **User feedback**: Log all conflict resolution decisions\n5. **Skip identical files**: Don't re-process files that are already in place\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### New Functions Needed\n- `check_path_conflicts(proposed_path)`: Check if target exists\n- `resolve_naming_conflict(base_path)`: Generate unique directory name\n- `files_are_identical(file1, file2)`: Compare file content/metadata\n\n### Integration Points\n- Add conflict checking before file move operations\n- Integrate with the move functionality (Issue #2)\n- Update path planning logic to account for resolved conflicts\n\n### Conflict Resolution Strategy\n1. **For Album Directories**:\n   ```bash\n   # If \"Artist/Album (2020)\" exists, try:\n   # \"Artist/Album (2020)_1\"\n   # \"Artist/Album (2020)_2\" \n   # etc.\n   ```\n\n2. **For Individual Files**:\n   - Compare checksums to detect identical files\n   - Skip if identical, rename if different\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Detects when target paths already exist\n- [ ] Compares existing files to determine if identical\n- [ ] Generates unique directory names when conflicts occur\n- [ ] Logs all conflict resolution decisions\n- [ ] Skips processing of identical files/albums\n- [ ] Prevents accidental overwriting of existing organized music\n- [ ] Works with both dry-run and live modes\n\n## Dependencies\n- File move functionality from Issue #2\n- Checksum verification from Issue #3 (for identical file detection)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)",

It is crucial for systematically evaluating and prioritizing enriched opportunities, transforming a simple list of jobs into a strategically ranked queue of high-potential leads. It also directly supports Issue #45 (`feat: Implement multi-dimensional scoring matrix for CV content`).\n\n**Atomic Nature & No CI Impact:**\n-   This task involves pure Python logic and will reside in `src/python/`.\n-   Development and testing will be conducted in isolation using local Python environments.\n-   No changes will be made to existing CI workflows or core JavaScript files.\n-   Dependencies will be managed locally and will not affect the current CI environment or its dependencies.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n-   A Python module (`src/python/mcda_engine.py`) implementing the MCDA framework.\n-   Local unit tests for the engine.\n\n**References:**\n-   `docs/research/autonomous-career-agent-plan.md` (Module III: The Multi-Criteria Decision Framework)\n-   Issue #45: `feat: Implement multi-dimensional scoring matrix for CV content`",

These warnings indicate the use of deprecated packages, unsupported modules, and the use of `--force` which disables recommended protections.\n\n**Observed Warnings:**\n```\nnpm warn using --force Recommended protections disabled.\nnpm warn deprecated rimraf @3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported\nnpm warn deprecated inflight @1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.\nnpm warn deprecated glob @7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported\nnpm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3: Use @eslint/object-schema instead\nnpm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0: Use @eslint/config-array instead\nnpm warn deprecated eslint @8.57.1: This version is no longer supported. Please see https://eslint.org/version-support for other options.\n```\n\n**Impact:**\n- **Security Risks**: Deprecated or unsupported modules may contain unpatched vulnerabilities.\n- **Maintainability**: Reliance on outdated packages can lead to compatibility issues with newer Node.js versions or other dependencies.\n- **Performance**: Some warnings (e.g., `inflight`) explicitly mention performance issues (memory leaks).\n- **Build Stability**: Warnings can obscure more critical errors and indicate underlying instability in the dependency tree.\n\n**Remediation:**\nInvestigate each warning and take appropriate action:\n- **`--force` usage**: Determine why `--force` is necessary and if it can be removed by resolving underlying dependency conflicts.\n- **Deprecated packages**: Update `rimraf`, `inflight`, `glob`, `@humanwhocodes/object-schema`, `@humanwhocodes/config-array`, and `eslint` to their supported versions or replace them with actively maintained alternatives.\n- **Unsupported modules**: Address the `inflight` warning by replacing the module as suggested (e.g., `lru-cache`).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- `npm install` completes without any `npm warn` messages related to deprecated or unsupported packages.\n- The `--force` flag is no longer required for `npm install`.\n- The project's dependencies are up-to-date and stable.",

This absence hinders the continuous improvement of the AI's scoring model and content optimization strategies.\n\n**Remediation:**\nImplement a mechanism to collect and integrate recruiter and peer feedback into the CV enhancement process. This could involve:\n- Designing a simple feedback collection interface or process (e.g., a web form, direct email integration).\n- Structuring feedback to be actionable and quantifiable (e.g., ratings on relevance, clarity, impact).\n- Integrating collected feedback into the scoring model to refine weights and thresholds for AI content generation.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- The system can collect structured feedback from external stakeholders (recruiters, peers).\n- Feedback is used to refine the AI's content generation and scoring models.\n- The feedback loop contributes to continuous improvement of the CV's effectiveness.",

This matrix is currently a conceptual framework and is not yet implemented within the system.\n\n**Remediation:**\nImplement the proposed multi-dimensional scoring matrix to provide a more granular and objective evaluation of the AI-generated CV content. This will involve:\n- Defining quantifiable indicators for each dimension (e.g., industry vernacular usage, persuasive impact, technical claim verification).\n- Integrating automated tools (e.g., grammar checkers, semantic similarity metrics) where applicable.\n- Developing a composite scoring mechanism that combines these indicators into an overall quality score.\n- Establishing quality gates that trigger revision cycles for content falling below thresholds.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- The system can generate a multi-dimensional score for AI-enhanced CV content.\n- The scoring matrix incorporates contextual alignment, linguistic quality, factual accuracy, and strategic relevance.\n- Scores are used to identify areas for improvement and potentially trigger automated or human review processes.",

Additionally, maintaining a consistent tone (balancing professional gravitas with marketing impact) across all AI-generated content is crucial for a polished final product.\n\n**Remediation:**\nImplement mechanisms to ensure and evaluate narrative coherence and tone consistency in AI-enhanced content. This could involve:\n- Developing metrics or heuristics to compare the semantic similarity and tone of the AI-enhanced summary with other CV sections.\n- Incorporating feedback loops or human-in-the-loop review processes to assess and refine tone and narrative flow.\n- Refining prompt engineering to explicitly guide the AI on maintaining coherence and desired tone.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- AI-enhanced content seamlessly integrates with the rest of the CV, maintaining a consistent narrative.\n- The tone of AI-generated content aligns with the overall professional persona.\n- Metrics or qualitative assessments confirm improved coherence and tone consistency.",

This results in blank or incomplete live stats, undermining the factual integrity and dynamic nature of the CV.\n\n**Remediation:**\nInvestigate why `activity-summary.json` is not being generated or deployed. This may involve:\n- Verifying the `activity-analyzer.js` script's output path and file writing permissions.\n- Ensuring the `activity-tracker.yml` workflow successfully generates and commits this file.\n- Confirming that the deployment process (`cv-enhancement.yml`) correctly includes `activity-summary.json` in the deployed assets.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- `activity-summary.json` is consistently generated and deployed to the `data/` directory of the live CV site.\n- Live statistics on the CV website are correctly populated with data from `activity-summary.json`.",

The site therefore cannot display recent GitHub activity or languages, leaving the 'Commits (30 days)' and other live stats blank. Such gaps undermine factual integrity.\"\n\n**Strategic Insight:** Resolving this issue is fundamental for ensuring the factual integrity and dynamic nature of the CV. Without accurate and complete activity data, the \"live\" aspect of the CV is compromised, and the AI enhancement process lacks crucial context. This fix is essential for the system to accurately reflect the user's current professional activity.",

          "body": "### Strategic Insight: Integrating with Career GitOps for Historical Analysis\n\nThis issue, `Implement Historical CV/Resume Foundation Analysis via rclone`, can be strategically integrated with the \"Career GitOps\" model outlined in `docs/research/autonomous-career-agent-plan.md`.\n\nThe `autonomous-career-agent-plan.md` discusses treating the Git repository as a version-controlled database for `job_database.json` and `application_log.json`. This concept can be extended to include historical versions of the CV itself (`base-cv.json` and its generated outputs).\n\n**Strategic Insight:**\n-   **Versioned CV History**: Implement a system to commit historical versions of the `base-cv.json` and its generated outputs (e.g., PDF, HTML) to the repository. This creates an immutable audit trail of the CV's evolution.\n-   **rclone for Off-site Backup/Synchronization**: Utilize `rclone` to synchronize this historical CV data to secure, off-site cloud storage. This provides robust backup and disaster recovery capabilities for the user's career history.\n-   **Historical Analysis**: With versioned CV data, future enhancements could involve analyzing the evolution of skills, experience, and professional narratives over time, providing deeper insights into career progression.\n\nThis approach leverages the GitOps model for data integrity and extends it to encompass the entire CV history, enhancing both reliability and analytical capabilities.",

There's an opportunity to provide deeper insights and a more engaging user experience through advanced data visualization.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIntegrate a lightweight charting library like **Chart.js** or **D3.js** into the frontend (`script.js`).\n\n**Proposed Visualizations:**\n1.  **Activity Heatmap:** A GitHub-style contribution calendar showing commit frequency and intensity.\n2.  **Skills Radar Chart:** A radar chart to visualize proficiency across different skill categories (e.g., 'Programming Languages', 'AI & Data Science', 'DevOps').\n3.  **Project Timeline:** An interactive timeline visualization for projects, showing their duration and status.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- The `skills` section includes a new radar chart visualization.\n- A new 'Activity' section or a modal is created to show the contribution heatmap.\n- The frontend `script.js` is updated to render these charts using data from the JSON files.\n- The charts are responsive and theme-aware (work in both light and dark modes).",

Please describe.**\nThe `LANGUAGE_SKILLS` map in `activity-analyzer.js`, which defines skill categories and weights, is currently hardcoded. This makes it inflexible and requires a code change to update.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n1.  Externalize the `LANGUAGE_SKILLS` configuration into a new JSON or YAML file (e.g., `config/skills_config.json`).\n2.  Update `activity-analyzer.js` to load this configuration file at runtime.\n3.  This would allow the skill assessment logic to be customized without modifying the core script.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- A new `config/skills_config.json` file is created with the current skills map.\n- `activity-analyzer.js` is refactored to load and use this external config file.\n- The README is updated to document how to customize the skill weightings.",

While functional, this approach is brittle and hard to maintain. A small change to the HTML structure requires updating multiple lines of JavaScript code.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nRefactor `cv-generator.js` to use a lightweight and logic-less templating engine like **EJS** or **Handlebars**.\n\n**Implementation Plan**\n1. Convert the dynamic parts of `index.html` into a template file (e.g., `index.ejs`).\n2. Replace string replacement logic in `cv-generator.js` with calls to the templating engine, passing in the CV data object.\n3. This will cleanly separate the presentation (HTML structure) from the application logic (data compilation).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- The `cv-generator.js` script no longer uses `String.prototype.replace` for HTML generation.\n- A new template file (e.g., `index.ejs`) is used for the HTML structure.\n- The final `dist/index.html` output is identical to the current output.\n- The code is cleaner and easier to read.",

These classes have very similar `httpRequest` methods and caching logic. This represents duplicated code that could be consolidated.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n1.  Create a new shared utility script (e.g., `.github/scripts/utils/apiClient.js`).\n2.  This new script should export a generic `ApiClient` class or a set of utility functions for making HTTP requests, handling retries, and managing caching.\n3.  Refactor `activity-analyzer.js` and `claude-enhancer.js` to import and use this shared utility, removing the duplicated code from each script.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- A new shared API client utility is created.\n- Duplicated `httpRequest` and caching logic is removed from the analyzer and enhancer scripts.\n- Both scripts now import and use the shared utility.\n- The overall functionality of the system remains unchanged.",

This should involve:\n- Stripping all formatting (bold, italics, bullet points, etc.).\n- Ensuring a simple, linear structure (Contact Information -> Summary -> Experience -> Skills -> Education).\n- Incorporating keyword optimization, potentially leveraging insights from the `activity-analyzer.js` to highlight relevant skills and technologies based on GitHub activity.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- A new step is added to the `cv-enhancement.yml` workflow to generate `adrian-wedd-cv-ats.txt`.\n- The generated TXT file is stored in the `dist/assets` directory.\n- The content is plain text, without any special formatting.\n- The structure is consistent and optimized for ATS parsing.\n- Relevant keywords are present to improve ATS matching.",

To cater to diverse application requirements (e.g., direct uploads to job portals, academic submissions), support for additional document formats like DOCX and LaTeX is needed.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nExtend the `cv-generator.js` script and the GitHub Actions workflow to generate the CV in multiple formats, including DOCX and LaTeX. This will involve:\n- Integrating appropriate libraries or tools for DOCX generation (e.g., `docx` npm package).\n- Integrating tools for LaTeX generation, potentially by converting the structured data into a `.tex` file and compiling it.\n- Updating the `cv-enhancement.yml` workflow to trigger the generation of these new formats.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- The `cv-generator.js` script is updated to support generating DOCX and LaTeX formats.\n- New steps are added to the `cv-enhancement.yml` workflow to generate `adrian-wedd-cv.docx` and `adrian-wedd-cv.tex` (and potentially compiled PDF from LaTeX).\n- The generated files are stored in the `dist/assets` directory.\n- The DOCX output is template-based with standard formatting.\n- The LaTeX output adheres to academic/research formatting standards, including a publications section if applicable.\n- The `index.html` download links are updated to include these new formats.",

However, this could be enhanced to provide more detailed insights into the CI pipeline's performance (duration) and cost (AI token usage) over time.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n1.  **Refine Usage Tracking**: The `Usage Analytics Recording` step should be enhanced to save a structured log of each workflow run. This log should include:\n    -   Job durations for each stage (analysis, enhancement, generation).\n    -   Precise token counts (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`) returned from the `claude-enhancer.js` script. The current implementation estimates tokens in the workflow.\n    -   A unique workflow run ID for traceability.\n2.  **Update Workflow Summary**: The `Workflow Summary Report` step should be updated to display this more detailed performance and cost data, making it easy to see at a glance how each run performed.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- The `claude-enhancer.js` script is updated to output its final token usage stats in a machine-readable format (e.g., to a file or stdout).\n- The `cv-enhancement.yml` workflow captures this output and records it in the `cv-usage-tracking.json` file.\n- The GitHub Actions summary is updated to show a breakdown of job durations and the actual token cost for the run.",

Please describe.**\nOnce the CV is deployed to GitHub Pages, there is no automated process to ensure it remains healthy. A broken asset link, a failed deployment, or an issue with the hosting could go unnoticed.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nCreate a new, separate GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., `health-check.yml`) that runs on a schedule (e.g., once daily).\n\n**Health Check Tasks:**\n- **Availability Check**: Use `curl` to check that the live URL (`https://adrianwedd.github.io/cv`) returns a `200 OK` status.\n- **Content Check**: Verify that the page contains expected content, such as the title 'Adrian Wedd - AI Engineer & Software Architect'.\n- **Asset Check**: Check that critical assets like `assets/styles.css` and `assets/script.js` load correctly.\n- **Data Freshness Check**: Fetch `data/activity-summary.json` from the live site and verify that its `last_updated` timestamp is recent (e.g., within the last 24 hours).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- A new `health-check.yml` workflow is created.\n- The workflow runs daily.\n- If any check fails, the workflow fails, providing a clear notification of the problem.\n- A status badge for this health check could be added to the `README.md`.",

Upon inspection of `.github/workflows/cv-enhancement.yml`, it has been determined that the implementation is incomplete.\n\n**Specific Gaps:**\n1.  **Precise Token Counts**: The `Usage Analytics Recording` step currently uses `estimated_tokens` based on the enhancement mode. It does not capture precise `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` directly from the `claude-enhancer.js` script, as specified in the original issue.\n2.  **Job Durations**: The workflow does not explicitly capture or display job durations for each stage (analysis, enhancement, generation).\n3.  **Workflow Summary Update**: The `Workflow Summary Report` does not yet display a breakdown of job durations or the actual token cost for the run.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria for this Follow-up:**\n- The `claude-enhancer.js` script is modified to output precise `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` in a machine-readable format.\n- The `cv-enhancement.yml` workflow is updated to capture these precise token counts and job durations.\n- The `Workflow Summary Report` step is enhanced to display job durations and actual token costs.",

Upon inspection of `cv-generator.js`, no implementation for DOCX or LaTeX generation was found.\n\n**Specific Gaps:**\n- No integration of libraries or logic for DOCX generation.\n- No integration of tools or logic for LaTeX generation.\n- The `cv-enhancement.yml` workflow does not include steps for generating these formats.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria for this Follow-up:**\n- The `cv-generator.js` script is updated to support generating DOCX and LaTeX formats.\n- New steps are added to the `cv-enhancement.yml` workflow to generate `adrian-wedd-cv.docx` and `adrian-wedd-cv.tex`.\n- The generated files are stored in the `dist/assets` directory.",

Upon inspection of `cv-generator.js`, no logic for generating a `.txt` file was found.\n\n**Specific Gaps:**\n- No implementation for generating a plain text version of the CV.\n- The `cv-enhancement.yml` workflow does not include steps for generating this format.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria for this Follow-up:**\n- The `cv-generator.js` script is updated to generate a plain text (`.txt`) version of the CV.\n- The generated TXT file is stored in the `dist/assets` directory.\n- The content is plain text, without any special formatting, and structured for ATS parsing.",

Upon inspection of `activity-analyzer.js`, the `LANGUAGE_SKILLS` map is still hardcoded within the script.\n\n**Specific Gaps:**\n- The `LANGUAGE_SKILLS` map is not externalized into a separate configuration file.\n- `activity-analyzer.js` does not load skill configurations from an external source.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria for this Follow-up:**\n- A new JSON or YAML file (e.g., `config/skills_config.json`) is created with the current skills map.\n- `activity-analyzer.js` is refactored to load and use this external configuration file at runtime.\n- The README is updated to document how to customize the skill weightings.",

Generic Role-Playing (Lines 344, 584)\n**Current**: `\"You are a professional CV enhancement specialist\"`\n**Problem**: Vague, lacks specific expertise depth\n**Impact**: Generic, uninspired responses\n\n#### 2. Data Dump Context Integration (Lines 349-353)\n**Current**: Bullet-point data presentation\n**Problem**: Context not woven into narrative, feels disconnected\n**Impact**: AI doesn't understand context relationships\n\n#### 3. Laundry List Requirements (Lines 355-361)\n**Current**: Bulleted enhancement requirements\n**Problem**: Lacks cohesive enhancement philosophy\n**Impact**: Fragmented, checklist-style responses\n\n#### 4. Static Professional Assumptions (Line 353)\n**Current**: Hard-coded \"AI Engineering, Software Architecture, Autonomous Systems\"\n**Problem**: May not match actual user profile\n**Impact**: Misaligned enhancement focus\n\n#### 5. Missing Output Structure (Lines 365-366)\n**Current**: Vague \"provide an enhanced professional summary\"\n**Problem**: No format specification or quality criteria\n**Impact**: Inconsistent, unstructured responses\n\n#### 6. Creativity Level Tokenism (Line 363)\n**Current**: `\"**Creativity Level:** ${CONFIG.CREATIVITY_LEVEL}\"`\n**Problem**: Mentioned but not integrated into prompt strategy\n**Impact**: Creativity parameter has no real effect\n\n### 🚀 Prompt Engineering Solution Strategy\n\n#### Phase 1: Advanced Role Definition with Expertise Depth\n```javascript\nconst expertPersona = {\n  professional_summary: `You are Dr. Sarah Chen, a senior executive recruiter specializing in AI/ML leadership roles at Fortune 500 companies. You've placed over 200 AI engineers in senior positions and understand exactly what makes a professional summary compelling to both ATS systems and human decision-makers.`,\n  \n  skills_analysis: `You are Marcus Rodriguez, a technical skills assessment consultant who has analyzed over 1,000 GitHub profiles for major tech companies. You understand the correlation between GitHub activity patterns and real-world technical competency.`\n};\n```\n\n#### Phase 2: Contextual Narrative Integration\n```javascript\nconst contextualPrompt = `\nBased on your analysis of this professional's GitHub activity (${activityScore}/100 activity score, ${topLanguages} expertise, ${repoCount} repositories), you've identified someone with ${professionalArchetype} characteristics.\n\nTheir recent contribution pattern suggests ${activityInsight}, and their language diversity indicates ${technicalBreadth}.\n`;\n```\n\n#### Phase 3: Creativity-Driven Prompt Strategies\n```javascript\nconst creativityStrategies = {\n  conservative: {\n    approach: \"evidence-based optimization\",\n    tone: \"authoritative and proven\",\n    structure: \"traditional executive summary format\"\n  },\n  \n  creative: {\n    approach: \"innovative positioning and unique value narrative\",\n    tone: \"confident thought leadership voice\", \n    structure: \"compelling story-driven format\"\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### Phase 4: Structured Output Specifications\n```javascript\nconst outputFormat = `\nProvide your response in this exact JSON structure:\n{\n  \"enhanced_content\": \"The optimized professional summary\",\n  \"strategic_rationale\": \"Why these specific changes improve positioning\",\n  \"ats_optimization\": \"Keywords and phrases optimized for ATS systems\",\n  \"differentiation_factors\": [\"unique\", \"value\", \"propositions\"],\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.95\n}\n`;\n```\n\n### 🔧 Technical Implementation\n\n#### Enhanced Professional Summary Prompt\n```javascript\nconst professionalSummaryPrompt = `\nYou are Alexandra Kim, Senior Executive Recruiter at Google DeepMind, specializing in AI engineering leadership roles.

Factual Contradictions\n- **Risk**: AI inventing roles, companies, or achievements not in historical data\n- **Detection**: Cross-reference with historical CV documents (Issue #34)\n- **Validation**: Fact-checking against LinkedIn, GitHub, and documented career history\n\n#### 2. Technical Impossibilities  \n- **Risk**: AI claiming expertise in technologies that didn't exist during claimed timeframes\n- **Detection**: Timeline validation against technology release dates\n- **Validation**: GitHub commit history correlation with claimed technical experience\n\n#### 3. Quantification Fabrication\n- **Risk**: AI generating specific metrics without evidence (e.g., \"improved performance by 73%\")\n- **Detection**: Flag specific percentages, dollar amounts, user counts without supporting data\n- **Validation**: Require evidence links or mark as estimates\n\n#### 4. Role/Responsibility Inflation\n- **Risk**: AI exaggerating job titles, team sizes, or project scope\n- **Detection**: Compare enhanced descriptions with original historical data\n- **Validation**: Consistency scoring against documented responsibilities\n\n### 🔬 Detection Architecture\n\n#### Phase 1: Real-time Hallucination Scoring\n```javascript\nclass HallucinationDetector {\n  async validateEnhancement(originalContent, enhancedContent, historicalContext) {\n    const scores = {\n      factual_consistency: await this.checkFactualAlignment(enhancedContent, historicalContext),\n      technical_plausibility: await this.validateTechnicalClaims(enhancedContent),\n      quantification_evidence: await this.assessQuantifiedClaims(enhancedContent),\n      timeline_coherence: await this.validateTimelineConsistency(enhancedContent, historicalContext)\n    };\n    \n    return {\n      hallucination_risk_score: this.calculateRiskScore(scores),\n      flagged_issues: this.identifyProblematicContent(scores),\n      validation_recommendations: this.generateValidationActions(scores)\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Phase 2: Automated Issue Creation\n- **High Risk Detection**: Auto-create GitHub issues for content requiring human review\n- **Evidence Collection**: Link supporting documentation or flag missing evidence\n- **Correction Workflow**: Provide suggested corrections with confidence scores\n- **Approval Process**: Human validation required for high-risk content\n\n#### Phase 3: Continuous Learning\n- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from validated corrections to improve detection\n- **False Positive Reduction**: Refine detection algorithms based on human feedback\n- **Risk Profiling**: Develop risk profiles for different content types and AI creativity levels\n\n### 🤖 Integration with Enhancement Pipeline\n\n#### Pre-Enhancement Validation\n```yaml\n- name: 🔍 Load Historical Validation Context\n  run: |\n    echo \"🔍 **LOADING HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR HALLUCINATION DETECTION**\"\n    \n    #

document.documentElement.classList.add('reduced-motion');\n    }\n    \n    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--animation-speed', '0.4s');\n    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--hover-intensity', '0.8');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Dyslexia-Optimized Interactions\n```javascript\nclass DyslexiaAnimations {\n  static getPreferences() {\n    return {\n      clarity: 'high-contrast-states',  // Clear before/after states\n      stability: 'minimal-movement',    // Reduce moving elements\n      focus: 'clear-visual-hierarchy',  // Strong focus indicators\n      readability: 'text-stability',    // No moving text\n      support: 'shape-color-cues'       // Visual rather than text cues\n    };\n  }\n\n  static applyOptimizations() {\n    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--focus-outline', '3px solid var(--accent-primary)');\n    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--text-animation', 'none');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 🎭 Advanced Interaction Components\n\n#### Smart Tooltip System\n```css\n.tooltip {\n  position: relative;\n  cursor: help;\n}\n\n.tooltip::before,\n.tooltip::after {\n  position: absolute;\n  opacity: 0;\n  pointer-events: none;\n  transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);\n  transform: translateY(10px);\n}\n\n.tooltip::before {\n  content: attr(data-tooltip);\n  bottom: 100%;\n  left: 50%;\n  transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(10px);\n  background: hsla(220, 13%, 8%, 0.95);\n  color: var(--text-primary);\n  padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem;\n  border-radius: 6px;\n  font-size:

Intelligent Animation Loading\n```javascript\nclass AnimationManager {\n  constructor() {\n    this.prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;\n    this.neurotype = localStorage.getItem('neurotype-preference') || 'neurotypical';\n    this.setupAnimationPreferences();\n  }\n\n  setupAnimationPreferences() {\n    if (this.prefersReducedMotion) {\n      document.documentElement.classList.add('reduced-motion');\n      return;\n    }\n\n    switch (this.neurotype) {\n      case 'adhd':\n        ADHDAnimations.applyOptimizations();\n        break;\n      case 'autism':\n        AutismAnimations.applyOptimizations();\n        break;\n      case 'dyslexia':\n        DyslexiaAnimations.applyOptimizations();\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  initializeScrollAnimations() {\n    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(\n      (entries) => {\n        entries.forEach(entry => {\n          if (entry.isIntersecting) {\n            entry.target.classList.add('in-view');\n            observer.unobserve(entry.target);\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      { threshold: 0.1, rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px' }\n    );\n\n    document.querySelectorAll('.scroll-reveal').forEach(el => {\n      observer.observe(el);\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 🎯 \"Must-Hire\" Technical Demonstration\n\nThis micro-interaction system

}\n}\n```\n\n### 🚀 Performance-First Mobile Design\n\n#### Critical CSS Strategy\n```css\n/* Above-the-fold critical styles */\n.critical-css {\n  /* Essential layout and typography */\n  font-display: swap;\n  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n  color: var(--text-primary);\n  background: var(--surface-primary);\n}\n\n/* Lazy-loaded enhancements

response:', responseTime + 'ms');\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  }\n\n  reportMetrics() {\n    return {\n      device_info: this.deviceInfo,\n      performance_metrics: this.metrics,\n      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations()\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 🎯 Cross-Device Excellence\n\n#### Progressive Enhancement Strategy\n```javascript\nclass ResponsiveEnhancer {\n  constructor() {\n    this.capabilities = this.detectCapabilities();\n    this.applyEnhancements();\n  }\n\n  detectCapabilities() {\n    return {\n      touch: 'ontouchstart' in window,\n      hover:

applyEnhancements() {\n    if (this.capabilities.touch && \\!this.capabilities.hover) {\n      document.body.classList.add('touch-device');\n      this.optimizeForTouch();\n    }\n\n    if (this.capabilities.highDPI) {\n      document.body.classList.add('high-dpi');\n      this.loadHighResAssets();\n    }\n\n    if (this.capabilities.networkSpeed === 'slow-2g' || \n        this.capabilities.networkSpeed === '2g') {\n      document.body.classList.add('slow-connection');\n      this.optimizeForSlowConnection();\n    }\n  }\n\n  optimizeForTouch() {\n    // Increase touch targets\n    document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--min-touch-size', '48px');\n    \n    // Disable hover effects\n    document.body.classList.add('no-hover');\n    \n    // Enable

Specifically, there is no documentation or logging of:\n- How the AI prompts were constructed.\n- The specific Claude AI models used for each enhancement.\n- Any human intervention or review steps in the AI content generation.\n\nThis lack of transparency hinders reproducibility, debugging, and continuous improvement of the AI enhancement pipeline.\n\n**Remediation:**\nImplement mechanisms to document and log the details of AI prompt construction and model usage. This could involve:\n- Modifying `claude-enhancer.js` to log the full prompts sent to the Claude API.\n- Recording the specific Claude model version used for each enhancement.\n- Documenting any manual review or intervention steps in the workflow.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- The documentation clearly explains the prompt engineering strategy.\n- The `ai-enhancements.json` or a related log file includes details on prompts and model versions used.\n- The workflow allows for traceability of AI-generated content back to its generation parameters.",

Additionally, maintaining a consistent tone (balancing professional gravitas with marketing impact) across all AI-generated content is crucial for a polished final product.\n\n**Remediation:**\nImplement mechanisms to ensure and evaluate narrative coherence and tone consistency in AI-enhanced content. This could involve:\n- Developing metrics or heuristics to compare the semantic similarity and tone of the AI-enhanced summary with other CV sections.\n- Incorporating feedback loops or human-in-the-loop review processes to assess and refine tone and narrative flow.\n- Refining prompt engineering to explicitly guide the AI on maintaining coherence and desired tone.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- AI-enhanced content seamlessly integrates with the rest of the CV, maintaining a consistent narrative.\n- The tone of AI-generated content aligns with the overall professional persona.\n- Metrics or qualitative assessments confirm improved coherence and tone consistency.",

While the AI enhancement process may implicitly consider these, there isn't an explicit, automated module that generates actionable suggestions based on these trends.\n\n**Remediation:**\nDevelop and integrate an automated suggestions module that leverages market trend analysis to provide actionable recommendations for CV content optimization. This could involve:\n- Integrating external data sources on industry trends (if feasible).\n- Enhancing the AI's prompt engineering to explicitly generate suggestions aligned with market demands.\n- Creating a dedicated section in the AI enhancement output for these strategic suggestions.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- The system can identify and incorporate current AI/ML market trends into its enhancement suggestions.\n- An automated module generates specific, actionable recommendations for CV content based on these trends.\n- The recommendations help differentiate the professional profile and highlight unique achievements.",

These warnings indicate the use of deprecated packages, unsupported modules, and the use of `--force` which disables recommended protections.\n\n**Observed Warnings:**\n```\nnpm warn using --force Recommended protections disabled.\nnpm warn deprecated rimraf @3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported\nnpm warn deprecated inflight @1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.\nnpm warn deprecated glob @7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported\nnpm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3: Use @eslint/object-schema instead\nnpm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0: Use @eslint/config-array instead\nnpm warn deprecated eslint @8.57.1: This version is no longer supported. Please see https://eslint.org/version-support for other options.\n```\n\n**Impact:**\n- **Security Risks**: Deprecated or unsupported modules may contain unpatched vulnerabilities.\n- **Maintainability**: Reliance on outdated packages can lead to compatibility issues with newer Node.js versions or other dependencies.\n- **Performance**: Some warnings (e.g., `inflight`) explicitly mention performance issues (memory leaks).\n- **Build Stability**: Warnings can obscure more critical errors and indicate underlying instability in the dependency tree.\n\n**Remediation:**\nInvestigate each warning and take appropriate action:\n- **`--force` usage**: Determine why `--force` is necessary and if it can be removed by resolving underlying dependency conflicts.\n- **Deprecated packages**: Update `rimraf`, `inflight`, `glob`, `@humanwhocodes/object-schema`, `@humanwhocodes/config-array`, and `eslint` to their supported versions or replace them with actively maintained alternatives.\n- **Unsupported modules**: Address the `inflight` warning by replacing the module as suggested (e.g., `lru-cache`).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- `npm install` completes without any `npm warn` messages related to deprecated or unsupported packages.\n- The `--force` flag is no longer required for `npm install`.\n- The project's dependencies are up-to-date and stable.",

This involves:\n- Extracting quantifiable claims from AI-generated content.\n- Cross-referencing these claims with metrics available from the GitHub API (e.g., commit counts, stars, languages, repository activity).\n- Flagging discrepancies or unsubstantiated claims for review or requiring user input for verification.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- The system can identify quantifiable claims within AI-generated text.\n- A process exists to compare these claims against actual GitHub data.\n- Unsubstantiated claims are flagged, and a mechanism for human review or data input is established.",

This results in blank or incomplete live stats, undermining the factual integrity and dynamic nature of the CV.\n\n**Remediation:**\nInvestigate why `activity-summary.json` is not being generated or deployed. This may involve:\n- Verifying the `activity-analyzer.js` script's output path and file writing permissions.\n- Ensuring the `activity-tracker.yml` workflow successfully generates and commits this file.\n- Confirming that the deployment process (`cv-enhancement.yml`) correctly includes `activity-summary.json` in the deployed assets.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- `activity-summary.json` is consistently generated and deployed to the `data/` directory of the live CV site.\n- Live statistics on the CV website are correctly populated with data from `activity-summary.json`.",

          "body": "### Resolution: Missing Activity Data for Live Stats Fixed\n\n**Problem:** Live statistics on the CV website showed \"---\" placeholders instead of actual GitHub data.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n1.  JavaScript was looking for data at incorrect paths (expected `summary.raw_data.commits` but actual was `summary.total_commits`).\n2.  CV generator was not copying the `data/activity/` directory needed for detailed language data.\n3.  Language count loading failed because the data structure path was incorrect.\n\n**Solution Implemented:**\n1.  Fixed JavaScript data paths in `assets/script.js` to use the correct `activity-summary.json` structure.\n2.  Updated the CV generator in `.github/scripts/cv-generator.js` to copy the entire `data/activity/` directory during deployment.\n3.  Corrected language loading in `assets/script.js` to use the right path (`repositories.summary.languages`).\n\n**Results:** Live stats now properly load from GitHub API data, ensuring the dynamic aspects of the CV are functioning correctly.\n\nClosing this issue.",

        "message": "fix: Resolve Watch Me Work dashboard data issues (rate limiting)\n\n🎯 **Problem Solved**: Watch Me Work dashboard was non-functional due to:\n- Client-side GitHub API calls hitting rate limits (60 requests/hour)\n- No secure authentication method for client-side requests\n- Multiple concurrent API calls exhausting quota quickly\n\n🔧 **Solution Implemented**:\n\n**1. Server-side Data Processing Pipeline**\n- Created `watch-me-work-data-processor.js` for authenticated GitHub API access\n- Processes all data server-side with full API access and rate limiting protection\n- Generates static JSON file (`data/watch-me-work-data.json`) for client consumption\n\n**2. Updated Dashboard Client**\n- Replaced direct GitHub API calls with static data loading\n- Added comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms\n- Enhanced UI with loading states, error messages, and retry functionality\n- Maintained all existing features while eliminating rate limit issues\n\n**3. GitHub Actions Integration**\n- Added Watch Me Work data processing step to CV enhancement workflow\n- Runs after GitHub activity collection with authenticated access\n- Generates fresh data every 6 hours automatically\n\n**4. Enhanced Features**:\n- Pre-computed metrics for better performance\n- Smart repository filtering (includes forks with recent activity)\n- Unified timeline combining commits, issues, and GitHub activities\n- Detailed error states with user-friendly messages\n\n**📊 Technical Details**:\n- Eliminates ~100+ API calls per dashboard load\n- Reduces client-side API requests from 100+ to 1 static file fetch\n- Uses authenticated GitHub API in CI/CD for full access\n- Processes up to 100 activities, 50 commits, 30 issues/PRs per refresh\n\n**✅ Results**:\n- Dashboard now loads reliably without rate limit errors\n- Data stays fresh through automated CI/CD pipeline\n- Better performance with pre-processed data\n- Enhanced error handling and user experience\n\nFixes #116\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",

      "body": "### 🐛 Bug: \"About Me\" section contains LLM meta-commentary artifacts\n\n**Problem Description:**\nThe AI-generated content for the \"Professional Summary\" within the \"About Me\" section of the CV includes meta-commentary and explanations from the Large Language Model (LLM), rather than solely the refined professional summary. This extraneous text appears as \"artifacts\" in the final output, reducing the professionalism and conciseness of the CV.\n\n**Problematic Content Example (from \"About Me\" section):**\n```\nHere's an enhanced professional summary: **Enhanced Summary:** Results-driven AI Engineer and Software Architect who has successfully delivered 15+ autonomous systems that have increased operational efficiency by an average of 40% across enterprise clients. Combining deep expertise in Python and TypeScript with advanced machine learning implementations, I architect scalable AI solutions that bridge the gap between theoretical ML models and production-ready systems. Recognized for pioneering human-AI collaborative frameworks that have reduced decision-making latency by 60% while maintaining 99.9% system reliability, with particular focus on real-time processing and autonomous agent orchestration in mission-critical environments. This enhancement: - Opens with a strong, measurable impact statement - Incorporates specific technical expertise - Includes quantifiable achievements - Maintains credibility while highlighting excellence - Uses active, authoritative language - Focuses on business value and technical capability - Emphasizes both AI expertise and practical implementation - Concludes with specific domain focus The numbers provided are placeholders that should be adjusted to match actual achievements, but the structure effectively positions the candidate as a senior technical professional who delivers measurable business impact.\n```\nThe text \"Here's an enhanced professional summary:\" and \"This enhancement: - Opens with a strong, measurable impact statement...\" are examples of these artifacts.\n\n**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**\nThe prompt provided to the LLM (Claude AI) for generating the professional summary is likely instructing it to explain its process or provide meta-analysis alongside the generated content.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nReview and revise the prompt used to generate the \"Professional Summary\" in `claude-enhancer.js` to ensure the LLM outputs *only* the desired summary content, without any meta-commentary or extraneous explanations. This may involve:\n*   Refining instructions to be more direct and explicit about the desired output format.\n*   Utilizing XML tags (Issue #97) to clearly delineate the expected output section.\n*   Implementing post-processing in `claude-enhancer.js` to strip any remaining artifacts if prompt refinement alone is insufficient.\n\n**Related Issues:**\n*   #33: Comprehensive Prompt Engineering Overhaul for Enhanced AI Output Quality\n*   #44: Ensure narrative coherence and tone consistency in AI-enhanced content\n*   #97: Implement XML Tag Structuring for Claude Prompts\n*   #96: Integrate Few-Shot Prompting into AI Enhancement\n*   #92: Utilize System Prompts for Persona-Driven AI Responses\n*   #94: Adopt \"Tool Use\" Paradigm for Structured JSON Output\n*   #98: Develop a Version-Controlled Prompt Library\n\n**Priority:** This is a **P1: High** bug as it directly impacts the quality and professionalism of the generated CV.",

      "body": "### Problem\nThe `watch-me-work.html` dashboard, designed to display live GitHub activity, is currently unable to fetch and display data. This is due to its implementation making direct API calls to `api.github.com` from client-side JavaScript (`assets/watch-me-work.js`).\n\n### Root Cause\nClient-side direct calls to the GitHub API are subject to severe rate limits (60 requests per hour per IP for unauthenticated requests) and cannot securely utilize Personal Access Tokens (PATs). This leads to rapid exhaustion of the rate limit, preventing data from being loaded. Exposing PATs in client-side code is also a significant security vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\nThe \"Watch Me Work\" dashboard is non-functional, failing to provide real-time insights into development activity.\n\n### Current Implementation Analysis\n- `assets/watch-me-work.js` contains `loadUserActivity()`, `loadRepositoryData()`, `loadRecentCommits()`, and `loadIssuesAndPRs()` functions that directly `fetch` data from `https://api.github.com`.\n- `CONFIG.USERNAME` is hardcoded, and no authentication mechanism is used for these client-side requests.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nThe `watch-me-work.html` dashboard should be refactored to consume pre-processed GitHub activity data, aligning with the existing architecture where data is collected and processed within the GitHub Actions environment.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Export from CI**\n1.  Modify the `activity-analyzer.js` script (or a new dedicated script) to export the relevant GitHub activity data (e.g., recent commits, issues, PRs, repository stats) into a static JSON file (e.g., `data/watch-me-work-data.json`) after each successful CI run.\n2.  Ensure this JSON file is committed to the repository and deployed with GitHub Pages.\n\n**Phase 2: Client-Side Consumption**\n1.  Update `assets/watch-me-work.js` to fetch data from this static `data/watch-me-work-data.json` file instead of making direct GitHub API calls.\n2.  Implement client-side filtering and display logic based on this pre-processed data.\n\nThis approach will:\n-   Resolve GitHub API rate limit issues for the dashboard.\n-   Eliminate security risks associated with client-side API key exposure.\n-   Ensure the dashboard always displays the latest data processed by the CI pipeline.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- `watch-me-work.html` dashboard successfully loads and displays GitHub activity data.\n- No direct GitHub API calls are made from `assets/watch-me-work.js`.\n- GitHub activity data is pre-processed and served statically.\n\n### Priority\nP1: High (Dashboard is a key visualization feature and currently non-functional).",

      "body": "### Problem Statement\n\nTo enhance the quality, consistency, and controllability of Claude AI outputs, a standardized XML-based prompt structuring mechanism needs to be fully implemented and integrated into the AI enhancement pipeline. This ensures that all prompts adhere to a clear, machine-readable format, leveraging Claude's fine-tuning for XML.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\nThe project has already established a robust framework for XML prompt structuring:\n\n-   **`AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` (`.github/scripts/enhancer-modules/advanced-xml-prompt-constructor.js`):** This module is the primary component responsible for constructing XML-structured prompts. Its `buildXMLStructure` method dynamically generates prompts with various sections like `<meta_instructions>`, `<expert_context>`, `<candidate_analysis>`, `<few_shot_learning>`, `<current_content>`, `<enhancement_requirements>`, and `<response_instructions>`.\n-   **Documentation:** The XML prompt structure is well-documented in `docs/prompt_construction.md` and `docs/research/claude-prompt-engineering-framework.md`.\n-   **Integration with `PromptLibraryManager.js`:** The `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor` is designed to work with `PromptLibraryManager.js` (Issue #98) to load templates, personas, and schemas, which are then used to populate the XML structure.\n\nThis issue focuses on ensuring the full and correct utilization of this XML structuring capability across all relevant AI enhancement tasks, and verifying its impact on Claude's output quality.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n-   **Universal XML Structuring:** All prompts generated for Claude AI enhancement tasks (e.g., professional summary generation, skills enhancement, experience enhancement) utilize the defined XML prompt structure.\n-   **Dynamic Content Population:** The XML tags are dynamically populated with relevant data (candidate analysis, context, few-shot examples) from the system.\n-   **Output Quality Improvement:** AI-generated content demonstrates improved adherence to desired formats, reduced meta-commentary, and enhanced overall quality due to the structured prompts.\n-   **Error Handling:** The prompt construction process gracefully handles missing or malformed input data, providing informative errors.\n-   **Unit Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests are implemented for `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` to ensure the correct generation of XML prompts under various conditions.\n-   **Documentation Alignment:** The implementation aligns with the XML prompt structure documented in `docs/prompt_construction.md`.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n1.  **Review and Refine `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js`:**\n    *   Ensure all dynamic data (e.g., `contextData`, `fewShotExamples`, `validationSchema`) is correctly and securely injected into the XML structure.\n    *   Verify that the XML output is always well-formed and valid.\n2.  **Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests:**\n    *   Create or enhance `test-xml-prompt-integration.js` to cover all aspects of XML prompt construction.\n    *   Test different `promptType` and `creativityLevel` combinations.\n    *   Verify the presence and correct formatting of all expected XML tags and their content.\n    *   Test edge cases, such as missing `contextData` or empty `fewShotExamples`.\n3.  **Integrate with AI Enhancement Workflows:** Ensure that the `claude-enhancer.js` (or similar orchestrator) correctly calls `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` to generate prompts for all AI enhancement tasks.\n4.  **Monitor Output Quality:** After deployment, monitor Claude's output for improvements in structure and quality, and iterate on prompt construction if necessary.\n\n### Dependency Mapping\n\nThis issue is closely dependent on:\n-   **#98 (Develop a Version-Controlled Prompt Library):** `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` relies on `PromptLibraryManager.js` to load prompt components. #98 should ideally be completed or have significant progress before this issue is fully tackled.\n\n### Effort Estimation\n\n**Medium.** The core logic is present, but ensuring comprehensive coverage, robust error handling, and full integration will require dedicated development and testing. Estimated time: 1-2 days.",

Claude Max OAuth (if authenticated and quota available)\n2. API Key fallback (after OAuth failure conditions met)\n3. Activity-only mode (if both fail)\n```\n\n#### 4.2 Intelligent Fallback Logic\n- **Immediate Fallback Triggers**:\n  - OAuth authentication completely fails\n  - Max subscription quota exhausted (wait for 5-hour reset)\n  - Consecutive OAuth failures > 3 attempts\n\n- **24-Hour Fallback Strategy**:\n  - If OAuth fails for 24 consecutive hours → switch to API key\n  - Continue OAuth retry attempts every 4 hours in background\n  - Auto-switch back to OAuth when available\n\n#### 4.3 Configuration Management\n```json\n{\n  \"auth_strategy\": \"oauth_first\",\n  \"fallback_delay_hours\": 24,\n  \"oauth_retry_interval_hours\": 4,\n  \"max_oauth_failures\": 3,\n  \"subscription_tier\": \"max_5x\"\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 5: GitHub Actions Integration\n\n#### 5.1 Secrets Configuration\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}\n  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}  # Fallback only\n```\n\n#### 5.2 Workflow Updates\n- Update `.github/workflows/cv-enhancement.yml`\n- Add OAuth token refresh logic\n- Implement fallback detection and switching\n- Add usage monitoring integration\n\n### Phase 6: Monitoring & Analytics\n\n#### 6.1 Enhanced Usage Tracking\n- OAuth vs API key usage ratios\n- Cost savings analysis (OAuth vs API billing)\n- Fallback trigger frequency and causes\n- System reliability metrics\n\n#### 6.2 Alert System\n- OAuth authentication failures\n- Quota exhaustion warnings\n- Fallback mode activations\n- Budget threshold breaches\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Authentication Flow\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Start Enhancement] --> B{OAuth Token Valid?}\n    B -->|Yes| C{Quota Available?}\n    B -->|No| D[Try OAuth Refresh]\n    C -->|Yes| E[Use OAuth]\n    C -->|No| F[Check Fallback Conditions]\n    D -->|Success| C\n    D -->|Fail| F\n    F --> G{24hr Fallback Met?}\n    G -->|Yes| H[Use API Key]\n    G -->|No| I[Wait for Quota Reset]\n    E --> J[Enhancement Success]\n    H --> J\n    I --> K[Activity-Only Mode]\n```\n\n### Error Recovery Chain\n```javascript\nconst authChain = [\n  { method: 'oauth_max', priority: 1, cost: 'fixed' },\n  { method: 'api_key', priority: 2, cost: 'variable', condition: '24hr_fallback' },\n  { method: 'activity_only', priority: 3, cost: 'free', always_available: true }\n];\n```\n\n## Files Modified/Created\n\n### New Files ✅\n- `claude-oauth-client.js` -

Claude Max OAuth (CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN) - Fixed monthly costs\n2. API Key fallback (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) - Variable costs, emergency use\n3. Activity-only mode - Free, GitHub analysis only\n```\n\n**Current Issue**: Both OAuth and API key authentication appear to be failing\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Repository Secrets Required\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: \"sk-ant-...\" # Required for fallback authentication\n  CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN: \"oauth-...\" # Optional, for cost optimization\n```\n\n### Validation Steps\n1. Verify secret is properly configured in repository settings\n2. Check secret name matches exactly: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`\n3. Ensure API key has proper permissions and credits\n4. Test with manual workflow dispatch\n\n## Prevention Measures\n\n### Monitoring Enhancements\n- Add secret expiration monitoring\n- Implement authentication health checks\n- Create alerts for consecutive workflow failures\n- Add cost monitoring for API usage\n\n### Documentation Updates\n- Update README with secret configuration steps\n- Add troubleshooting guide for authentication failures\n- Document fallback mode behavior clearly\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` configured in repository secrets\n- [ ] Manual workflow run completes successfully\n- [ ] Scheduled workflow runs resume normal operation\n- [ ] CV enhancement data updates properly\n- [ ] No authentication errors in workflow logs\n\n## Priority Justification\n\n**P0: Critical** because:\n- Core system functionality completely broken\n- Automated CV updates non-functional for extended period\n- Professional portfolio becoming stale\n- Simple configuration fix can restore full functionality\n\n## Related Issues\n- #107: OAuth-First Authentication (may provide alternative solution)\n- #15: CI performance and cost monitoring (prevention)\n- #16: Scheduled health check workflow (monitoring)\n\n**Immediate action required to restore core system functionality.**",

      "body": "### Epic: Frontend Improvement Roadmap\n\nThis Epic tracks the strategic implementation and optimization of the CV interface's frontend, focusing on enhancing user experience, readability, and responsiveness across all devices. It consolidates several related issues into a logical and dependent sequence.\n\n**Objective:** To deliver a highly polished, responsive, and interactive CV interface that effectively showcases the user's professional profile.\n\n**Proposed Optimal Implementation Sequence:**\n\n1.  **#75: Implement responsive design for mobile devices**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a foundational UX improvement. Ensuring the CV is viewable and usable on all devices is paramount. Other visual enhancements and interactive features will benefit from a solid responsive base.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium to Large\n\n2.  **#73: Bullet points are presented as plain paragraphs with hyphens**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a core rendering bug that affects readability. Fixing this ensures basic content is displayed correctly before more complex visualizations are introduced. It might involve HTML structure changes that could impact other rendering.\n    *   **Effort:** Small\n\n3.  **#72: Concatenated technology stacks lack separators**\n    *   **Rationale:** Similar to #73, this is a basic readability issue. Ensuring proper separators for lists of technologies/skills improves clarity. It might be a quick fix or involve structural changes that could benefit #74.\n    *   **Effort:** Small\n\n4.  **#76: Split long paragraphs into digestible chunks**\n    *   **Rationale:** This improves overall content readability and scannability. It's a content-level enhancement that makes the CV more digestible, regardless of other interactive features.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n5.  **#77: Provide feedback for external link failures**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a user experience improvement for external interactions. It's independent of content rendering and can be implemented once the basic layout is stable.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n6.  **#78: Make metrics interactive (optional)**\n    *   **Rationale:** This enhances the display of existing metrics. It can be built once the core layout and content rendering are stable. It might benefit from accurate data from #80 and #81.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n7.  **#74: Enhance Skills section visualization**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a significant visual enhancement that builds upon the correct rendering of skills (from #72 and #73). It should be tackled after the foundational display issues are resolved.\n    *   **Effort:** Large\n\n**Overall Priority:** P1: High (as these issues are critical for core UI/UX and content presentation).\n\n**Status:** Planning / Groomed\n\n**Related Issues:** #71, #72, #73, #74, #75, #76, #77, #78\n",

      "body": "### Problem Statement\n\nTo ensure consistency, maintainability, and version control of Claude AI prompts, a dedicated library is required. Currently, prompt definitions might be scattered or hardcoded, making updates, testing, and collaboration challenging. This issue aims to establish a robust system for managing prompt components (personas, templates, schemas, few-shot examples) in a version-controlled manner.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\nThe project already contains foundational components for a prompt library:\n\n-   **`prompts/claude/v2.0/` directory structure:** This directory is intended to house versioned prompt components, including `personas`, `templates`, and `schemas`.\n-   **`PromptLibraryManager.js` (`.github/scripts/enhancer-modules/prompt-library-manager.js`):** This module is designed to load and manage prompt components from the defined directory structure. It includes methods for loading personas (YAML), templates (XML), and schemas (JSON).\n-   **`AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` (`.github/scripts/enhancer-modules/advanced-xml-prompt-constructor.js`):** This module utilizes the `PromptLibraryManager` to construct complex XML-structured prompts, incorporating dynamic data and few-shot examples.\n\nThe current implementation provides a strong starting point, but requires comprehensive testing and potential refinement to ensure robustness and full functionality as a version-controlled library.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n-   **Prompt Component Management:** The system can reliably load, manage, and retrieve prompt components (personas, templates, schemas) from the `prompts/claude/<version>/` directory structure.\n-   **Version Control:** Changes to prompt components (personas, templates, schemas) are tracked via Git, allowing for clear versioning and rollback capabilities.\n-   **Component Accessibility:** `PromptLibraryManager` provides clear and efficient methods to access specific prompt components by ID (e.g., `getPersona('senior-technical-recruiter')`, `getTemplate('professional-summary')`).\n-   **Component Listing:** `PromptLibraryManager` can list all available personas, templates, and schemas.\n-   **Robust Parsing:** The parsing logic within `PromptLibraryManager` (e.g., for YAML, XML, JSON files) is robust and handles various valid structures and potential edge cases.\n-   **Unit Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests are implemented for `PromptLibraryManager` to ensure its reliability and correctness.\n-   **Documentation:** Clear documentation is provided on how to add, update, and manage prompt components within the library.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n1.  **Review and Refine `PromptLibraryManager.js`:**\n    *   Thoroughly review existing loading and parsing logic for personas, templates, and schemas.\n    *   Enhance error handling for file not found, invalid format, or missing required fields within prompt components.\n    *   Ensure the `parseYAML` and `parseXMLTemplate` methods are robust enough for the expected complexity of prompt definitions.\n2.  **Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests:**\n    *   Create a dedicated test file (e.g., `test-prompt-library-manager.js`) to cover all functionalities of `PromptLibraryManager`.\n    *   Test loading of various valid and invalid prompt component files.\n    *   Test retrieval of components by ID and listing of all components.\n    *   Mock file system operations where necessary to ensure test isolation.\n3.  **Integrate with Existing Workflow:** Confirm that `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` (and any other relevant modules) correctly utilizes the `PromptLibraryManager` for prompt construction.\n4.  **Documentation:** Update `docs/prompt_construction.md` and potentially create a new guide (e.g., `docs/prompt_library_management.md`) detailing the process for adding/updating prompt components.\n\n### Dependency Mapping\n\nThis issue is foundational for all other prompt engineering enhancements, including:\n-   #97 (XML Tag Structuring for Claude Prompts)\n-   #96 (Integrate Few-Shot Prompting into AI Enhancement)\n-   #95 (Implement Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Complex AI Reasoning)\n-   #94 (Adopt \"Tool Use\" Paradigm for Structured JSON Output)\n-   #92 (Utilize System Prompts for Persona-Driven AI Responses)\n-   #91 (Implement Advanced AI Verification Techniques)\n-   #90 (Integrate Claude Citations API for Verifiable Claims)\n-   #89 (Integrate Bias Detection Prompts and Formalize Human-in-the-Loop)\n\nIt should be prioritized before extensive work on these dependent issues, as it provides the core mechanism for managing the prompts they will utilize.\n\n### Effort Estimation\n\n**Medium.** The core structure is in place, but robust testing, error handling, and comprehensive documentation will require dedicated effort. Estimated time: 1-2 days.",

      "body": "### Epic: Claude AI Enhancement Pipeline Optimization\n\nThis Epic tracks the strategic implementation and optimization of the Claude AI enhancement pipeline, focusing on foundational prompt engineering techniques to maximize AI output quality, consistency, and control. It consolidates several related issues into a logical and dependent sequence.\n\n**Objective:** To establish a robust, version-controlled, and highly effective Claude AI interaction framework for CV content enhancement.\n\n**Proposed Optimal Implementation Sequence:**\n\n1.  **#98: 🗃️ feat(claude): Develop a Version-Controlled Prompt Library**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the foundational prerequisite. A robust system for managing all prompt components (personas, templates, schemas, few-shot examples) is essential before implementing any advanced prompting techniques.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n2.  **#97: 📝 feat(claude): Implement XML Tag Structuring for Claude Prompts**\n    *   **Rationale:** Once the prompt library is established, defining and enforcing the universal XML structure for prompts is the next logical step. All other advanced prompting techniques (few-shot, CoT, Tool Use) build upon this structured format.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n3.  **#96: 💡 feat(claude): Integrate Few-Shot Prompting into AI Enhancement**\n    *   **Rationale:** Few-shot examples are a core method for guiding Claude's behavior and ensuring consistent output quality within the XML prompt structure. This can be implemented effectively once #97 is stable.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n4.  **#95: 🧠 feat(claude): Implement Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Complex AI Reasoning**\n    *   **Rationale:** CoT relies on the XML structure (`<thinking>` tags) and can be implemented once #97 is stable. It enhances Claude's reasoning capabilities.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n5.  **#92: 🎭 feat(claude): Utilize System Prompts for Persona-Driven AI Responses**\n    *   **Rationale:** System Prompts (managed by the prompt library #98) work in conjunction with the main prompt body (XML structure #97) to define Claude's persona and tone. This can be implemented in parallel with #96 and #95, as it primarily involves modifying the API call rather than the internal prompt structure.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n6.  **#94: 🔗 feat(claude): Adopt \"Tool Use\" Paradigm for Structured JSON Output**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the most significant architectural change for structured data extraction. It relies heavily on both the prompt library (for defining tool schemas) and the XML prompt structure. It should be tackled after the foundational prompt management and core XML structuring are solid and stable.\n    *   **Effort:** High\n\n**Overall Priority:** P1: High (as these issues are critical for core AI functionality and quality).\n\n**Status:** Planning / Groomed\n\n**Related Issues:** #92, #94, #95, #96, #97, #98\n",

      "body": "### Problem Statement\n\nThe current CV generation pipeline primarily relies on pre-structured JSON data. To enhance the system's capabilities and leverage a wider range of historical and external data, there is a need to implement a robust pipeline for ingesting and parsing unstructured documents such as:\n\n-   **Historical CVs/Resumes:** In various formats (PDF, DOCX, plain text).\n-   **Job Applications:** Submitted by the user.\n-   **Position Descriptions:** From previous jobs or target roles.\n\nThis unstructured data contains valuable information (skills, experience, responsibilities, requirements) that needs to be extracted and converted into a structured format compatible with our existing data models.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nDevelop a multi-stage ingestion and parsing pipeline:\n\n1.  **Document Conversion/Text Extraction:** Implement modules to convert various document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.) into clean, extractable plain text. Libraries like `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`, or similar will be explored.\n2.  **Information Extraction (NLP/Rule-Based):** Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and/or rule-based parsing to identify and extract key entities and relationships from the extracted text. This includes:\n    *   Personal information (name, contact).\n    *   Skills and technologies.\n    *   Work experience (company, title, dates, responsibilities).\n    *   Education.\n    *   Achievements and quantifiable results.\n    *   Job requirements from position descriptions.\n3.  **Data Structuring and Mapping:** Transform the extracted information into a standardized JSON format that aligns with the existing CV data schema.\n4.  **Error Handling and Validation:** Implement robust error handling for parsing failures and validation mechanisms to ensure data quality.\n\n### Initial Test Data\n\nThe files located in `temp/rclone_downloads/` will serve as initial test data for developing and validating this ingestion pipeline.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n-   A dedicated Python module (e.g., `src/python/document_parser.py` or similar) is created for document parsing.\n-   The pipeline successfully extracts key information from sample PDF and DOCX CVs/job descriptions into a structured format.\n-   The extracted data can be successfully integrated into the existing CV data model.\n-   Robust error handling is in place for malformed or unparseable documents.\n-   Unit tests are developed for the parsing and extraction logic.\n\n### Priority\n\nP1: High (This is foundational for leveraging new data sources and enhancing AI capabilities.)",

      "body": "## 🐛 **Voice Interface Failure Report**\n\nThe voice functionality in the terminal interface is currently broken and not working as expected. Users cannot activate voice commands or speech output.\n\n### 🔍 **Problem Description**\n\n**Current Status:** Voice interface fails to initialize or function properly\n**User Impact:** Complete loss of voice command functionality and accessibility features\n**Severity:** High - affects accessibility and core advertised features\n\n### 🛠 **Affected Components**\n\n**Files Involved:**\n- `assets/voice-interface.js` - Main voice interface class\n- `assets/terminal.js` - Voice integration and command handling\n- `index.html` - Voice control UI elements\n\n**UI Elements:**\n- Voice toggle button (`#voiceToggle`)\n- Speech output button (`#speechToggle`) \n- Voice status indicator (`#voiceIndicator`)\n- Voice status display (`#voiceStatus`)\n\n### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**\n\n#### **1. Browser API Requirements**\n- **Web Speech API** requires HTTPS connection\n- **Microphone permissions** must be explicitly granted\n- **User gesture** required for speech synthesis (autoplay policies)\n- **Browser compatibility** limited to Chrome/Edge primarily\n\n#### **2. Permission Handling Issues**\n```javascript\n// Current error handling in voice-interface.js:182-192\nthis.recognition.onerror = (event) => {\n  console.warn('Speech recognition error:', event.error);\n  \n  if (event.error === 'not-allowed' || event.error === 'service-not-allowed') {\n    this.showVoiceError('Microphone access required for voice interface');\n  } else if (event.error === 'network') {\n    this.showVoiceError('Network error - check internet connection');\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### **3. Initialization Sequence Problems**\n- Voice interface initialization may fail silently\n- No graceful degradation when APIs unavailable\n- Missing error feedback to user\n- Auto-restart logic may cause infinite loops\n\n### 🧪 **Expected vs Actual Behavior**\n\n**Expected:**\n- Voice toggle button activates listening\n- Wake words (\"Adrian\", \"Computer\") trigger command mode\n- Speech recognition converts voice to terminal commands\n- Text-to-speech provides audio feedback\n- Proper error messages for permission issues\n\n**Actual:**\n- Voice interface fails to start\n- No response to voice commands\n- UI indicators show error states\n- Console shows permission or API errors\n\n### 📋 **Debugging Steps Performed**\n\n#### **Browser API Support Check:**\n```javascript\n// APIs required for voice functionality:\n- window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition\n- window.speechSynthesis\n- window.SpeechSynthesisUtterance\n```\n\n#### **Common Failure Points:**\n1. **Microphone Permissions:** Not requested or denied\n2. **HTTPS Requirement:** Web Speech API requires secure context\n3. **Browser Support:** Limited to Chromium-based browsers\n4. **Network Connectivity:** Speech recognition needs internet\n5. **User Gesture:** Required for speech synthesis to work\n\n### 🔧 **Proposed Solutions**\n\n#### **1. Enhanced Permission Handling**\n- Add explicit permission request flow\n- Improve error messaging and user guidance\n- Graceful fallback when permissions denied\n\n#### **2. Initialization Improvements**\n- Better API availability detection\n- User-friendly error reporting\n- Progressive enhancement approach\n\n#### **3. Browser Compatibility**\n- Add browser support detection\n- Show compatibility warnings\n- Provide alternative interaction methods\n\n#### **4. User Experience Fixes**\n- Clear onboarding for voice setup\n- Visual feedback for permission states\n- Better error recovery mechanisms\n\n### 🧪 **Testing Requirements**\n\n**Test Cases Needed:**\n- [ ] Permission request flow\n- [ ] HTTPS vs HTTP behavior  \n- [ ] Different browser compatibility\n- [ ] Network connectivity issues\n- [ ] Microphone hardware problems\n- [ ] Speech synthesis voice loading\n- [ ] Wake word detection accuracy\n- [ ] Command recognition precision\n\n### 💡 **Implementation Priority**\n\n**High Priority:**\n1. Fix permission request flow\n2. Add proper error handling\n3. Improve user feedback\n\n**Medium Priority:**\n1. Browser compatibility warnings\n2. Enhanced wake word detection\n3. Voice command accuracy\n\n**Low Priority:**\n1. Advanced voice settings\n2. Multiple language support\n3. Voice training features\n\n### 📈 **Success Criteria**\n\n- [ ] Voice interface initializes without errors\n- [ ] Microphone permissions properly requested\n- [ ] Clear error messages for common issues\n- [ ] Wake word detection functional\n- [ ] Voice commands execute correctly\n- [ ] Speech output works as expected\n- [ ] Graceful degradation when unavailable\n\n### 🔗 **Related Issues**\n\nThis issue is related to the overall accessibility and usability of the terminal interface. Voice functionality is a core feature that affects user experience significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Priority:** High\n**Type:** Bug Fix\n**Component:** Voice Interface\n**Accessibility Impact:** Severe",

Address remaining command failures (home, ls, uptime, neofetch, ps)\n2. Review index.html for potential errors\n3. Continue terminal interface enhancements\n\n## 📈 **Impact**\n\nThis work significantly improves code quality, developer experience, and provides comprehensive testing infrastructure for the terminal interface. The CLI audit framework now serves as a robust quality assurance tool for ongoing development.\n\nImplementation completed with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",

Testing should be done with:\n> 1. Dry-run mode first (`./music_sorter.sh`)\n> 2. Small test directories before processing large collections\n> 3. Review log files in detail before using `--move` flag\n\nThis manual testing approach needs to be supplemented with automated tests.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Test Framework Setup\n- **Bash testing framework**: Consider `bats-core` (Bash Automated Testing System)\n- **Test directory structure**: Organized test cases with sample music files\n- **CI Integration**: Ensure tests run automatically on commits/PRs\n\n### Test Categories Needed\n\n#### 1. **Unit Tests**\n- `sanitize_filename()`: Test filename sanitization with various problematic characters\n- `check_dependencies()`: Mock missing dependencies\n- `get_log_level_name()`: Test all log level mappings\n- Metadata parsing functions\n\n#### 2. **Integration Tests**  \n- **Album processing**: Test complete album analysis workflow\n- **Quality detection**: Test Lossless/Lossy/Mixed classification\n- **Path generation**: Test target directory structure creation\n- **Error handling**: Test problematic albums (missing metadata, etc.)\n\n#### 3. **End-to-End Tests**\n- **Dry-run mode**: Verify no actual file changes occur\n- **Complete workflow**: Source → Analysis → Target path planning\n- **Configuration loading**: Test config file parsing and CLI overrides\n- **Logging**: Verify log file content and format\n\n#### 4. **Edge Case Tests**\n- **Various Artists** compilations\n- **Multi-disc albums** \n- **Special characters** in metadata (Unicode, symbols)\n- **Missing/inconsistent metadata**\n- **Mixed file formats** within albums\n- **Empty directories**\n- **Symbolic links**\n\n### Test Data Requirements\nCreate test music collection with:\n- Sample albums with good metadata\n- Albums with missing/bad metadata  \n- Multi-disc albums\n- Various Artists compilations\n- Mixed quality albums (FLAC + MP3)\n- Files with problematic characters in names/metadata\n\n## Implementation Plan\n1. **Choose testing framework** (recommend `bats-core`)\n2. **Create `tests/` directory** structure\n3. **Generate test music files** (or use Creative Commons samples)\n4. **Write test cases** for each component\n5. **Add CI workflow** (GitHub Actions)\n6. **Document testing process** in README\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Automated test framework is set up and functional\n- [ ] Unit tests cover all core functions\n- [ ] Integration tests verify album processing workflow\n- [ ] End-to-end tests validate complete dry-run operations\n- [ ] Edge cases are properly tested\n- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline\n- [ ] Test coverage report is available\n- [ ] Documentation explains how to run tests\n\n## Benefits\n- **Catch regressions** during development\n- **Validate fixes** before deployment\n- **Document expected behavior** through test cases\n- **Enable confident refactoring**\n- **Ensure cross-platform compatibility**\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)",

A warning will be logged.\n\n## Current State\nThe specifications mention conflict resolution but it's not implemented. The script will need to handle cases where organized music already exists.\n\n## Requirements\nImplement conflict resolution logic that:\n\n1. **Check for existing paths**: Before moving, verify if target directory/files exist\n2. **Identical content detection**: Compare files to determine if they're the same\n3. **Naming conflict resolution**: \n   - Append `_1`, `_2`, etc. to album directory names\n   - Handle both directory and file name conflicts\n4. **User feedback**: Log all conflict resolution decisions\n5. **Skip identical files**: Don't re-process files that are already in place\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### New Functions Needed\n- `check_path_conflicts(proposed_path)`: Check if target exists\n- `resolve_naming_conflict(base_path)`: Generate unique directory name\n- `files_are_identical(file1, file2)`: Compare file content/metadata\n\n### Integration Points\n- Add conflict checking before file move operations\n- Integrate with the move functionality (Issue #2)\n- Update path planning logic to account for resolved conflicts\n\n### Conflict Resolution Strategy\n1. **For Album Directories**:\n   ```bash\n   # If \"Artist/Album (2020)\" exists, try:\n   # \"Artist/Album (2020)_1\"\n   # \"Artist/Album (2020)_2\" \n   # etc.\n   ```\n\n2. **For Individual Files**:\n   - Compare checksums to detect identical files\n   - Skip if identical, rename if different\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Detects when target paths already exist\n- [ ] Compares existing files to determine if identical\n- [ ] Generates unique directory names when conflicts occur\n- [ ] Logs all conflict resolution decisions\n- [ ] Skips processing of identical files/albums\n- [ ] Prevents accidental overwriting of existing organized music\n- [ ] Works with both dry-run and live modes\n\n## Dependencies\n- File move functionality from Issue #2\n- Checksum verification from Issue #3 (for identical file detection)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)",

This extraneous text appears as \"artifacts\" in the final output, reducing the professionalism and conciseness of the CV.\n\n**Problematic Content Example (from \"About Me\" section):**\n```\nHere's an enhanced professional summary: **Enhanced Summary:** Results-driven AI Engineer and Software Architect who has successfully delivered 15+ autonomous systems that have increased operational efficiency by an average of 40% across enterprise clients. Combining deep expertise in Python and TypeScript with advanced machine learning implementations, I architect scalable AI solutions that bridge the gap between theoretical ML models and production-ready systems. Recognized for pioneering human-AI collaborative frameworks that have reduced decision-making latency by 60% while maintaining 99.9% system reliability, with particular focus on real-time processing and autonomous agent orchestration in mission-critical environments. This enhancement: - Opens with a strong, measurable impact statement - Incorporates specific technical expertise - Includes quantifiable achievements - Maintains credibility while highlighting excellence - Uses active, authoritative language - Focuses on business value and technical capability - Emphasizes both AI expertise and practical implementation - Concludes with specific domain focus The numbers provided are placeholders that should be adjusted to match actual achievements, but the structure effectively positions the candidate as a senior technical professional who delivers measurable business impact.\n```\nThe text \"Here's an enhanced professional summary:\" and \"This enhancement: - Opens with a strong, measurable impact statement...\" are examples of these artifacts.\n\n**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**\nThe prompt provided to the LLM (Claude AI) for generating the professional summary is likely instructing it to explain its process or provide meta-analysis alongside the generated content.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nReview and revise the prompt used to generate the \"Professional Summary\" in `claude-enhancer.js` to ensure the LLM outputs *only* the desired summary content, without any meta-commentary or extraneous explanations. This may involve:\n*   Refining instructions to be more direct and explicit about the desired output format.\n*   Utilizing XML tags (Issue #97) to clearly delineate the expected output section.\n*   Implementing post-processing in `claude-enhancer.js` to strip any remaining artifacts if prompt refinement alone is insufficient.\n\n**Related Issues:**\n*   #33: Comprehensive Prompt Engineering Overhaul for Enhanced AI Output Quality\n*   #44: Ensure narrative coherence and tone consistency in AI-enhanced content\n*   #97: Implement XML Tag Structuring for Claude Prompts\n*   #96: Integrate Few-Shot Prompting into AI Enhancement\n*   #92: Utilize System Prompts for Persona-Driven AI Responses\n*   #94: Adopt \"Tool Use\" Paradigm for Structured JSON Output\n*   #98: Develop a Version-Controlled Prompt Library\n\n**Priority:** This is a **P1: High** bug as it directly impacts the quality and professionalism of the generated CV.",

        "body": "### Problem\nThe `watch-me-work.html` dashboard, designed to display live GitHub activity, is currently unable to fetch and display data. This is due to its implementation making direct API calls to `api.github.com` from client-side JavaScript (`assets/watch-me-work.js`).\n\n### Root Cause\nClient-side direct calls to the GitHub API are subject to severe rate limits (60 requests per hour per IP for unauthenticated requests) and cannot securely utilize Personal Access Tokens (PATs). This leads to rapid exhaustion of the rate limit, preventing data from being loaded. Exposing PATs in client-side code is also a significant security vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\nThe \"Watch Me Work\" dashboard is non-functional, failing to provide real-time insights into development activity.\n\n### Current Implementation Analysis\n- `assets/watch-me-work.js` contains `loadUserActivity()`, `loadRepositoryData()`, `loadRecentCommits()`, and `loadIssuesAndPRs()` functions that directly `fetch` data from `https://api.github.com`.\n- `CONFIG.USERNAME` is hardcoded, and no authentication mechanism is used for these client-side requests.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nThe `watch-me-work.html` dashboard should be refactored to consume pre-processed GitHub activity data, aligning with the existing architecture where data is collected and processed within the GitHub Actions environment.\n\n**Phase 1: Data Export from CI**\n1.  Modify the `activity-analyzer.js` script (or a new dedicated script) to export the relevant GitHub activity data (e.g., recent commits, issues, PRs, repository stats) into a static JSON file (e.g., `data/watch-me-work-data.json`) after each successful CI run.\n2.  Ensure this JSON file is committed to the repository and deployed with GitHub Pages.\n\n**Phase 2: Client-Side Consumption**\n1.  Update `assets/watch-me-work.js` to fetch data from this static `data/watch-me-work-data.json` file instead of making direct GitHub API calls.\n2.  Implement client-side filtering and display logic based on this pre-processed data.\n\nThis approach will:\n-   Resolve GitHub API rate limit issues for the dashboard.\n-   Eliminate security risks associated with client-side API key exposure.\n-   Ensure the dashboard always displays the latest data processed by the CI pipeline.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- `watch-me-work.html` dashboard successfully loads and displays GitHub activity data.\n- No direct GitHub API calls are made from `assets/watch-me-work.js`.\n- GitHub activity data is pre-processed and served statically.\n\n### Priority\nP1: High (Dashboard is a key visualization feature and currently non-functional).",

        "body": "### Problem Statement\n\nTo enhance the quality, consistency, and controllability of Claude AI outputs, a standardized XML-based prompt structuring mechanism needs to be fully implemented and integrated into the AI enhancement pipeline. This ensures that all prompts adhere to a clear, machine-readable format, leveraging Claude's fine-tuning for XML.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\nThe project has already established a robust framework for XML prompt structuring:\n\n-   **`AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` (`.github/scripts/enhancer-modules/advanced-xml-prompt-constructor.js`):** This module is the primary component responsible for constructing XML-structured prompts. Its `buildXMLStructure` method dynamically generates prompts with various sections like `<meta_instructions>`, `<expert_context>`, `<candidate_analysis>`, `<few_shot_learning>`, `<current_content>`, `<enhancement_requirements>`, and `<response_instructions>`.\n-   **Documentation:** The XML prompt structure is well-documented in `docs/prompt_construction.md` and `docs/research/claude-prompt-engineering-framework.md`.\n-   **Integration with `PromptLibraryManager.js`:** The `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor` is designed to work with `PromptLibraryManager.js` (Issue #98) to load templates, personas, and schemas, which are then used to populate the XML structure.\n\nThis issue focuses on ensuring the full and correct utilization of this XML structuring capability across all relevant AI enhancement tasks, and verifying its impact on Claude's output quality.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n-   **Universal XML Structuring:** All prompts generated for Claude AI enhancement tasks (e.g., professional summary generation, skills enhancement, experience enhancement) utilize the defined XML prompt structure.\n-   **Dynamic Content Population:** The XML tags are dynamically populated with relevant data (candidate analysis, context, few-shot examples) from the system.\n-   **Output Quality Improvement:** AI-generated content demonstrates improved adherence to desired formats, reduced meta-commentary, and enhanced overall quality due to the structured prompts.\n-   **Error Handling:** The prompt construction process gracefully handles missing or malformed input data, providing informative errors.\n-   **Unit Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests are implemented for `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` to ensure the correct generation of XML prompts under various conditions.\n-   **Documentation Alignment:** The implementation aligns with the XML prompt structure documented in `docs/prompt_construction.md`.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n1.  **Review and Refine `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js`:**\n    *   Ensure all dynamic data (e.g., `contextData`, `fewShotExamples`, `validationSchema`) is correctly and securely injected into the XML structure.\n    *   Verify that the XML output is always well-formed and valid.\n2.  **Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests:**\n    *   Create or enhance `test-xml-prompt-integration.js` to cover all aspects of XML prompt construction.\n    *   Test different `promptType` and `creativityLevel` combinations.\n    *   Verify the presence and correct formatting of all expected XML tags and their content.\n    *   Test edge cases, such as missing `contextData` or empty `fewShotExamples`.\n3.  **Integrate with AI Enhancement Workflows:** Ensure that the `claude-enhancer.js` (or similar orchestrator) correctly calls `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` to generate prompts for all AI enhancement tasks.\n4.  **Monitor Output Quality:** After deployment, monitor Claude's output for improvements in structure and quality, and iterate on prompt construction if necessary.\n\n### Dependency Mapping\n\nThis issue is closely dependent on:\n-   **#98 (Develop a Version-Controlled Prompt Library):** `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` relies on `PromptLibraryManager.js` to load prompt components. #98 should ideally be completed or have significant progress before this issue is fully tackled.\n\n### Effort Estimation\n\n**Medium.** The core logic is present, but ensuring comprehensive coverage, robust error handling, and full integration will require dedicated development and testing. Estimated time: 1-2 days.",

Inconsistent naming can lead to confusion, increase cognitive load for developers, and hinder maintainability.\n\n### Scope\nThis audit will cover (but is not limited to):\n- File and directory names\n- Variable and function names in JavaScript and Python scripts\n- CSS class names and custom properties\n- JSON keys in data models\n- Workflow names and job IDs in GitHub Actions\n- Terminology used in all documentation files (`.md` files)\n\n### Objectives\n- Identify all instances of inconsistent naming.\n- Propose a standardized naming convention for each category (e.g., `kebab-case` for CSS, `camelCase` for JS variables, `snake_case` for Python variables).\n- Document the agreed-upon naming conventions in a central location (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a new `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`).\n- Create a plan for refactoring existing code and updating documentation to adhere to the new standards.\n\n### Deliverables\n- A report detailing current naming inconsistencies.\n- A proposed set of naming conventions.\n- A plan for implementing the standardization.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Naming convention issue created with clear objectives and scope.\n- Agreement on the proposed naming conventions.\n- A clear roadmap for refactoring and documentation updates.",

Claude Max OAuth (CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN) - Fixed monthly costs\n2. API Key fallback (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) - Variable costs, emergency use\n3. Activity-only mode - Free, GitHub analysis only\n```\n\n**Current Issue**: Both OAuth and API key authentication appear to be failing\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Repository Secrets Required\n```yaml\nsecrets:\n  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: \"sk-ant-...\" # Required for fallback authentication\n  CLAUDE_OAUTH_TOKEN: \"oauth-...\" # Optional, for cost optimization\n```\n\n### Validation Steps\n1. Verify secret is properly configured in repository settings\n2. Check secret name matches exactly: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`\n3. Ensure API key has proper permissions and credits\n4.

        "body": "### Epic: Frontend Improvement Roadmap\n\nThis Epic tracks the strategic implementation and optimization of the CV interface's frontend, focusing on enhancing user experience, readability, and responsiveness across all devices. It consolidates several related issues into a logical and dependent sequence.\n\n**Objective:** To deliver a highly polished, responsive, and interactive CV interface that effectively showcases the user's professional profile.\n\n**Proposed Optimal Implementation Sequence:**\n\n1.  **#75: Implement responsive design for mobile devices**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a foundational UX improvement. Ensuring the CV is viewable and usable on all devices is paramount. Other visual enhancements and interactive features will benefit from a solid responsive base.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium to Large\n\n2.  **#73: Bullet points are presented as plain paragraphs with hyphens**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a core rendering bug that affects readability. Fixing this ensures basic content is displayed correctly before more complex visualizations are introduced. It might involve HTML structure changes that could impact other rendering.\n    *   **Effort:** Small\n\n3.  **#72: Concatenated technology stacks lack separators**\n    *   **Rationale:** Similar to #73, this is a basic readability issue. Ensuring proper separators for lists of technologies/skills improves clarity. It might be a quick fix or involve structural changes that could benefit #74.\n    *   **Effort:** Small\n\n4.  **#76: Split long paragraphs into digestible chunks**\n    *   **Rationale:** This improves overall content readability and scannability. It's a content-level enhancement that makes the CV more digestible, regardless of other interactive features.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n5.  **#77: Provide feedback for external link failures**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a user experience improvement for external interactions. It's independent of content rendering and can be implemented once the basic layout is stable.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n6.  **#78: Make metrics interactive (optional)**\n    *   **Rationale:** This enhances the display of existing metrics. It can be built once the core layout and content rendering are stable. It might benefit from accurate data from #80 and #81.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n7.  **#74: Enhance Skills section visualization**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is a significant visual enhancement that builds upon the correct rendering of skills (from #72 and #73). It should be tackled after the foundational display issues are resolved.\n    *   **Effort:** Large\n\n**Overall Priority:** P1: High (as these issues are critical for core UI/UX and content presentation).\n\n**Status:** Planning / Groomed\n\n**Related Issues:** #71, #72, #73, #74, #75, #76, #77, #78\n",

        "body": "### Problem Statement\n\nTo ensure consistency, maintainability, and version control of Claude AI prompts, a dedicated library is required. Currently, prompt definitions might be scattered or hardcoded, making updates, testing, and collaboration challenging. This issue aims to establish a robust system for managing prompt components (personas, templates, schemas, few-shot examples) in a version-controlled manner.\n\n### Technical Analysis\n\nThe project already contains foundational components for a prompt library:\n\n-   **`prompts/claude/v2.0/` directory structure:** This directory is intended to house versioned prompt components, including `personas`, `templates`, and `schemas`.\n-   **`PromptLibraryManager.js` (`.github/scripts/enhancer-modules/prompt-library-manager.js`):** This module is designed to load and manage prompt components from the defined directory structure. It includes methods for loading personas (YAML), templates (XML), and schemas (JSON).\n-   **`AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` (`.github/scripts/enhancer-modules/advanced-xml-prompt-constructor.js`):** This module utilizes the `PromptLibraryManager` to construct complex XML-structured prompts, incorporating dynamic data and few-shot examples.\n\nThe current implementation provides a strong starting point, but requires comprehensive testing and potential refinement to ensure robustness and full functionality as a version-controlled library.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n-   **Prompt Component Management:** The system can reliably load, manage, and retrieve prompt components (personas, templates, schemas) from the `prompts/claude/<version>/` directory structure.\n-   **Version Control:** Changes to prompt components (personas, templates, schemas) are tracked via Git, allowing for clear versioning and rollback capabilities.\n-   **Component Accessibility:** `PromptLibraryManager` provides clear and efficient methods to access specific prompt components by ID (e.g., `getPersona('senior-technical-recruiter')`, `getTemplate('professional-summary')`).\n-   **Component Listing:** `PromptLibraryManager` can list all available personas, templates, and schemas.\n-   **Robust Parsing:** The parsing logic within `PromptLibraryManager` (e.g., for YAML, XML, JSON files) is robust and handles various valid structures and potential edge cases.\n-   **Unit Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests are implemented for `PromptLibraryManager` to ensure its reliability and correctness.\n-   **Documentation:** Clear documentation is provided on how to add, update, and manage prompt components within the library.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n1.  **Review and Refine `PromptLibraryManager.js`:**\n    *   Thoroughly review existing loading and parsing logic for personas, templates, and schemas.\n    *   Enhance error handling for file not found, invalid format, or missing required fields within prompt components.\n    *   Ensure the `parseYAML` and `parseXMLTemplate` methods are robust enough for the expected complexity of prompt definitions.\n2.  **Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests:**\n    *   Create a dedicated test file (e.g., `test-prompt-library-manager.js`) to cover all functionalities of `PromptLibraryManager`.\n    *   Test loading of various valid and invalid prompt component files.\n    *   Test retrieval of components by ID and listing of all components.\n    *   Mock file system operations where necessary to ensure test isolation.\n3.  **Integrate with Existing Workflow:** Confirm that `AdvancedXMLPromptConstructor.js` (and any other relevant modules) correctly utilizes the `PromptLibraryManager` for prompt construction.\n4.  **Documentation:** Update `docs/prompt_construction.md` and potentially create a new guide (e.g., `docs/prompt_library_management.md`) detailing the process for adding/updating prompt components.\n\n### Dependency Mapping\n\nThis issue is foundational for all other prompt engineering enhancements, including:\n-   #97 (XML Tag Structuring for Claude Prompts)\n-   #96 (Integrate Few-Shot Prompting into AI Enhancement)\n-   #95 (Implement Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Complex AI Reasoning)\n-   #94 (Adopt \"Tool Use\" Paradigm for Structured JSON Output)\n-   #92 (Utilize System Prompts for Persona-Driven AI Responses)\n-   #91 (Implement Advanced AI Verification Techniques)\n-   #90 (Integrate Claude Citations API for Verifiable Claims)\n-   #89 (Integrate Bias Detection Prompts and Formalize Human-in-the-Loop)\n\nIt should be prioritized before extensive work on these dependent issues, as it provides the core mechanism for managing the prompts they will utilize.\n\n### Effort Estimation\n\n**Medium.** The core structure is in place, but robust testing, error handling, and comprehensive documentation will require dedicated effort. Estimated time: 1-2 days.",

        "body": "### Epic: Claude AI Enhancement Pipeline Optimization\n\nThis Epic tracks the strategic implementation and optimization of the Claude AI enhancement pipeline, focusing on foundational prompt engineering techniques to maximize AI output quality, consistency, and control. It consolidates several related issues into a logical and dependent sequence.\n\n**Objective:** To establish a robust, version-controlled, and highly effective Claude AI interaction framework for CV content enhancement.\n\n**Proposed Optimal Implementation Sequence:**\n\n1.  **#98: 🗃️ feat(claude): Develop a Version-Controlled Prompt Library**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the foundational prerequisite. A robust system for managing all prompt components (personas, templates, schemas, few-shot examples) is essential before implementing any advanced prompting techniques.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n2.  **#97: 📝 feat(claude): Implement XML Tag Structuring for Claude Prompts**\n    *   **Rationale:** Once the prompt library is established, defining and enforcing the universal XML structure for prompts is the next logical step. All other advanced prompting techniques (few-shot, CoT, Tool Use) build upon this structured format.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n3.  **#96: 💡 feat(claude): Integrate Few-Shot Prompting into AI Enhancement**\n    *   **Rationale:** Few-shot examples are a core method for guiding Claude's behavior and ensuring consistent output quality within the XML prompt structure. This can be implemented effectively once #97 is stable.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n4.  **#95: 🧠 feat(claude): Implement Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Complex AI Reasoning**\n    *   **Rationale:** CoT relies on the XML structure (`<thinking>` tags) and can be implemented once #97 is stable. It enhances Claude's reasoning capabilities.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n5.  **#92: 🎭 feat(claude): Utilize System Prompts for Persona-Driven AI Responses**\n    *   **Rationale:** System Prompts (managed by the prompt library #98) work in conjunction with the main prompt body (XML structure #97) to define Claude's persona and tone. This can be implemented in parallel with #96 and #95, as it primarily involves modifying the API call rather than the internal prompt structure.\n    *   **Effort:** Medium\n\n6.  **#94: 🔗 feat(claude): Adopt \"Tool Use\" Paradigm for Structured JSON Output**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the most significant architectural change for structured data extraction. It relies heavily on both the prompt library (for defining tool schemas) and the XML prompt structure. It should be tackled after the foundational prompt management and core XML structuring are solid and stable.\n    *   **Effort:** High\n\n**Overall Priority:** P1: High (as these issues are critical for core AI functionality and quality).\n\n**Status:** Planning / Groomed\n\n**Related Issues:** #92, #94, #95, #96, #97, #98\n",

        "body": "## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, all development work is committed directly to the `main` branch, which poses risks to production stability:\n\n- **Production Impact**: Direct commits to main can break the live CV website\n- **CI/CD Disruption**: Failed builds affect scheduled enhancement pipelines  \n- **No Testing Environment**: Changes aren't tested in isolation before deployment\n- **Rollback Complexity**: Difficult to revert problematic changes quickly\n\n## Proposed Solution: Git Flow Development Workflow\n\n### Branch Strategy\n\n**Production Branches:**\n- `main` - Production-ready code, protected branch\n- `release/*` - Release preparation branches for final testing\n\n**Development Branches:**  \n- `develop` - Integration branch for features, the new \"default\" branch\n- `feature/*` - Individual feature development branches\n- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes that need immediate production deployment\n\n### Workflow Implementation\n\n#### 1. Branch Protection Rules\n```yaml\n# .github/branch-protection.yml\nmain:\n  protection_rules:\n    required_reviews: 1\n    dismiss_stale_reviews: true\n    require_code_owner_reviews: true\n    required_status_checks:\n      - \"CI/CD Pipeline\"\n      - \"PDF Generation Test\"\n      - \"Content Validation\"\n    enforce_admins: false\n    restrictions:\n      push: []\n      merge: [\"adrianwedd\"]\n```\n\n#### 2. Development Environment Setup\n- **Staging Environment**: `https://adrianwedd.github.io/cv-dev` (from develop branch)\n- **Feature Previews**: Deploy feature branches to `https://adrianwedd.github.io/cv-preview-{branch}`\n- **Production**: `https://adrianwedd.github.io/cv` (from main branch only)\n\n#### 3. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline\n\n**Development Pipeline** (develop branch):\n- Run every 2 hours for continuous testing\n- Deploy to staging environment\n- Full AI enhancement and testing\n- Generate test reports\n\n**Production Pipeline** (main branch):\n- Run every 6 hours (current schedule)\n- Deploy to production only after all checks pass\n- Include rollback capabilities\n\n#### 4. Automated Quality Gates\n\n**Pre-merge Checks:**\n- ✅ All tests pass\n- ✅ No ESLint errors\n- ✅ PDF generation succeeds\n- ✅ AI enhancement validation\n- ✅ No broken links or missing assets\n- ✅ Performance benchmarks met\n\n#### 5. Development Workflow Process\n\n**For New Features:**\n```bash\n# 1. Create feature branch from develop\ngit checkout develop\ngit pull origin develop\ngit checkout -b feature/new-enhancement\n\n# 2. Develop and test locally\nnpm run test\nnpm run lint\n\n# 3. Push and create PR to develop\ngit push origin feature/new-enhancement\ngh pr create --base develop --title \"feat: new enhancement\"\n\n# 4. After PR approval, merge to develop\n# 5. Develop deploys to staging automatically\n# 6. When ready for production, create release PR from develop to main\n```\n\n**For Hotfixes:**\n```bash\n# 1. Create hotfix branch from main\ngit checkout main\ngit checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix\n\n# 2. Fix and test\n# 3. Create PR to main (expedited review process)\n# 4.

        "body": "### Problem Statement\n\nThe current CV generation pipeline primarily relies on pre-structured JSON data. To enhance the system's capabilities and leverage a wider range of historical and external data, there is a need to implement a robust pipeline for ingesting and parsing unstructured documents such as:\n\n-   **Historical CVs/Resumes:** In various formats (PDF, DOCX, plain text).\n-   **Job Applications:** Submitted by the user.\n-   **Position Descriptions:** From previous jobs or target roles.\n\nThis unstructured data contains valuable information (skills, experience, responsibilities, requirements) that needs to be extracted and converted into a structured format compatible with our existing data models.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nDevelop a multi-stage ingestion and parsing pipeline:\n\n1.  **Document Conversion/Text Extraction:** Implement modules to convert various document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.) into clean, extractable plain text. Libraries like `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`, or similar will be explored.\n2.  **Information Extraction (NLP/Rule-Based):** Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and/or rule-based parsing to identify and extract key entities and relationships from the extracted text. This includes:\n    *   Personal information (name, contact).\n    *   Skills and technologies.\n    *   Work experience (company, title, dates, responsibilities).\n    *   Education.\n    *   Achievements and quantifiable results.\n    *   Job requirements from position descriptions.\n3.  **Data Structuring and Mapping:** Transform the extracted information into a standardized JSON format that aligns with the existing CV data schema.\n4.  **Error Handling and Validation:** Implement robust error handling for parsing failures and validation mechanisms to ensure data quality.\n\n### Initial Test Data\n\nThe files located in `temp/rclone_downloads/` will serve as initial test data for developing and validating this ingestion pipeline.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n-   A dedicated Python module (e.g., `src/python/document_parser.py` or similar) is created for document parsing.\n-   The pipeline successfully extracts key information from sample PDF and DOCX CVs/job descriptions into a structured format.\n-   The extracted data can be successfully integrated into the existing CV data model.\n-   Robust error handling is in place for malformed or unparseable documents.\n-   Unit tests are developed for the parsing and extraction logic.\n\n### Priority\n\nP1: High (This is foundational for leveraging new data sources and enhancing AI capabilities.)",

This significantly advances the unstructured document ingestion pipeline.\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n-   **Dependencies Installed:** `pdfminer.six` (for PDF) and `python-docx` (for DOCX) have been installed and are now used for text extraction.\n-   **`temp/process_cv_documents.py` Updated:** The script now utilizes these libraries to extract text directly from the respective file types.\n-   **End-to-End Test:** The entire pipeline, from real text extraction to Claude API parsing, has been successfully tested on the six sample documents. The structured JSON outputs are saved in `temp/parsed_cv_outputs/`.\n-   **`src/python/requirements.txt` Created:** A `requirements.txt` file has been added to `src/python/` to document the Python dependencies.\n\nThis completes the core functionality for unstructured document ingestion. The extracted text is now reliably fed into the Claude-powered `CVParser`.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nFurther work on this issue could involve:\n-   Refining the Claude prompt for even more accurate and comprehensive extraction.\n-   Implementing error handling for malformed documents that cannot be parsed by the extraction libraries.\n-   Integrating this pipeline into a broader workflow for automated ingestion.",

            "body": "### Progress Update: Document Processing and Claude API Integration Test\n\nI have successfully tested the `CVParser` with direct Claude API integration (using the provided `CLAUDE_API_KEY`) on the six sample documents. The parsed JSON outputs have been saved to `temp/parsed_cv_outputs/`.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n-   **PDF Files (`Adrian Wedd Current CV.pdf`, `Adrian Wedd CV.pdf`):** Text was simulated using the previously obtained OCR output. The `CVParser` successfully extracted structured data (name, contact, summary, experience, etc.) from this simulated text, demonstrating the parser's ability to process realistic CV content.\n-   **DOCX Files (`Adrian Wedd CV.docx`, `Adrian Wedd CV(1).docx`, `Adrian Wedd CV(2).docx`):** Text was simulated using a generic placeholder. The parser produced structured output based on this placeholder, confirming its general functionality.\n-   **TXT File (`Adrian_Wedd_CV.txt`):** The content was read directly from the file. The `CVParser` successfully extracted structured data from this plain text CV.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nThis successful test validates the core LLM-driven parsing logic. The next critical step for the unstructured document ingestion pipeline is to implement robust text extraction from actual PDF and DOCX files. This will involve integrating appropriate Python libraries (e.g., `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`) to convert these binary formats into plain text, which can then be fed into the `CVParser` for structured data extraction.",

This brings the unstructured document ingestion prototype closer to a functional state.\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n-   **`cv_parser.py`:**\n    -   Removed the mock response logic.\n    -   Implemented actual `requests` calls to the Claude API (`https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`).\n    -   The `_call_llm_for_parsing` method now constructs an XML prompt (as previously defined conceptually) and sends it to Claude.\n    -   Includes logic to extract the JSON object from Claude's response (assuming it's wrapped in `<json>` tags).\n    -   Incorporates robust error handling for API request failures and JSON decoding issues.\n    -   Requires `CLAUDE_API_KEY` to be set as an environment variable for authentication.\n-   **`test_cv_parser.py`:**\n    -   Updated to use `unittest.mock.patch` to simulate `requests.post` calls, ensuring tests remain isolated and do not make live API requests.\n    -   Includes test cases for successful API calls, API errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request), and scenarios where Claude's response does not contain the expected JSON.\n\nThis completes a major milestone for the unstructured document ingestion pipeline. The next steps will involve implementing text extraction from various document formats (PDF, DOCX) and then feeding that extracted text into this Claude-powered parser.",

This prototype demonstrates how unstructured CV text can be transformed into a structured JSON format by leveraging the capabilities of a large language model (LLM).\n\n**Key Achievements:**\n\n-   **`cv_parser.py`:** Refactored to include a `parse_cv` method that simulates an LLM call for parsing.\n-   **Conceptual XML Prompt:** A conceptual XML prompt structure is defined within the code, illustrating how raw CV text would be presented to an LLM (like Claude) for extraction, aligning with the project's existing prompt engineering framework.\n-   **Mock LLM Response:** For prototyping purposes, the `_call_llm_for_parsing` method returns a hardcoded structured JSON response, mimicking a successful LLM extraction.\n-   **Unit Tests:** `test_cv_parser.py` has been updated to validate the output of this new LLM-driven parsing logic, ensuring the structured data matches expectations.\n\nThis marks a significant step towards implementing the unstructured document ingestion pipeline, focusing on the strengths of LLMs for data transformation. The next steps will involve integrating actual LLM API calls and handling various document formats (PDF, DOCX) for text extraction prior to LLM processing.",

The `rclone` commands mentioned in the issue body are conceptual and not integrated into any workflow or script.\n*   **Document Processing:** There are no existing modules or scripts for:\n    *   PDF/DOC text extraction.\n    *   Career timeline reconstruction from unstructured text.\n    *   Skills evolution tracking.\n    *   Achievement pattern analysis from historical documents.\n    The `cv-generator.js` and `claude-enhancer.js` primarily operate on pre-structured JSON data (`base-cv.json`, `activity-summary.json`, `ai-enhancements.json`).\n*   **Contextual AI Enhancement:** The `claude-enhancer.js` does not have a mechanism to load or leverage historical career documents for factual grounding, consistency validation, or to reflect authentic career development trajectories.\n\n**Proposed Implementation Strategy:**\n\n#### Phase 1: Document Discovery & Retrieval\n*   **Tool**: `rclone` (or similar cloud storage synchronization tool).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   Configure `rclone` to access specified cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).\n    *   Implement scripts to search for and selectively retrieve historical career documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) to a local, untracked temporary directory.\n\n#### Phase 2: Document Analysis Pipeline\n*   **Components**: New scripts/modules (e.g., Python-based for robust text extraction and NLP).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   **Text Extraction**: Convert various document formats (PDF, DOCX) into analyzable plain text.\n    *   **Career Timeline Reconstruction**: Extract dates, roles, and responsibilities to build a chronological career timeline.\n    *   **Skills Evolution Tracking**: Identify and track the development and usage of skills over time.\n    *   **Achievement Pattern Analysis**: Analyze historical documents to quantify career progression and identify key achievements.\n\n#### Phase 3: Contextual AI Enhancement\n*   **Integration Point**: `claude-enhancer.js` (before AI processing).\n*   **Capabilities**:\n    *   **Factual Grounding**: Use the extracted historical career data to fact-check and ground AI-generated content, ensuring authenticity.\n    *   **Consistency Validation**: Validate that enhanced content aligns with historical facts and career progression.\n    *   **Hallucination Detection**: Flag AI outputs that contradict documented historical facts.\n\n**Expected Benefits:**\n*   **Authenticity**: Significantly improved factual accuracy and authenticity of AI-generated content.\n*   **Contextual Relevance**: Enhanced AI understanding of the user's actual career trajectory.\n*   **Consistency**: Elimination of contradictory information across documents.\n*   **Personalization**: Truly personalized enhancement based on real career data.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n*   **Document Processing Engine**: A new component (e.g., `HistoricalCareerAnalyzer` as suggested in the original issue) responsible for parsing and extracting structured data from historical documents.\n*   **Integration with Enhancement Pipeline**: The extracted historical context will be loaded and provided to the `claude-enhancer.js` before AI processing.\n\n**Potential Progress:**\nNo progress has been made on this issue. The functionality needs to be implemented from scratch.\n\n**Priority:** This is a high-value enhancement that transforms the system from generic AI enhancement to authentic career development based on real professional history. It is currently **P2: Medium**, which is appropriate.",

This will significantly improve search efficiency.\n\n**Refined Plan:**\n\n1.  **Targeted Search:** Utilize `rclone lsf` to search *only* within the provided Google Drive folder ID for files matching keywords like `application`, `cv`, `curriculum vitae` (case-insensitive, filename/path only).\n2.  **Preview Results:** The script will first list the identified files for review, without copying them.\n3.  **Conditional Copy:** Upon user confirmation, the identified files (including Google Docs, which will be exported as PDF/DOCX during copy) will be copied to the local `temp/rclone_downloads` directory.\n\nThis approach addresses concerns about large data volumes and provides better control over the discovery process.",

            "body": "### 🎯 Foundation Enhancement: Historical CV/Resume Foundation Analysis via rclone\n\n**Concept Origin:**\nIntegrate existing CV/resume/application documents from Google Drive (or other cloud storage) using `rclone` to provide a rich, contextual foundation for AI enhancement. This aims to replace generic assumptions with actual career history, leading to more authentic and accurate AI-generated content.\n\n**Current Implementation:**\nThere is currently no implementation for historical career document analysis.\n*   **`rclone` Integration:** The project does not currently utilize `rclone` or any other cloud storage integration for document discovery and retrieval. The `rclone` commands mentioned in the issue body are conceptual and not integrated into any workflow or script.\n*   **Document Processing:** There are no existing modules or scripts for:\n    *   PDF/DOC text extraction.\n    *   Career timeline reconstruction from unstructured text.\n    *   Skills evolution tracking.\n    *   Achievement pattern analysis from historical documents.\n    The `cv-generator.js` and `claude-enhancer.js` primarily operate on pre-structured JSON data (`base-cv.json`, `activity-summary.json`, `ai-enhancements.json`).\n*   **Contextual AI Enhancement:** The `claude-enhancer.js` does not have a mechanism to load or leverage historical career documents for factual grounding, consistency validation, or to reflect authentic career development trajectories.\n\n**Proposed Implementation Strategy:**\n\n#### Phase 1: Document Discovery & Retrieval\n*   **Tool**: `rclone` (or similar cloud storage synchronization tool).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   Configure `rclone` to access specified cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).\n    *   Implement scripts to search for and selectively retrieve historical career documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) to a local, untracked temporary directory.\n\n#### Phase 2: Document Analysis Pipeline\n*   **Components**: New scripts/modules (e.g., Python-based for robust text extraction and NLP).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   **Text Extraction**: Convert various document formats (PDF, DOCX) into analyzable plain text.\n    *   **Career Timeline Reconstruction**: Extract dates, roles, and responsibilities to build a chronological career timeline.\n    *   **Skills Evolution Tracking**: Identify and track the development and usage of skills over time.\n    *   **Achievement Pattern Analysis**: Analyze historical documents to quantify career progression and identify key achievements.\n\n#### Phase 3: Contextual AI Enhancement\n*   **Integration Point**: `claude-enhancer.js` (before AI processing).\n*   **Capabilities**:\n    *   **Factual Grounding**: Use the extracted historical career data to fact-check and ground AI-generated content, ensuring authenticity.\n    *   **Consistency Validation**: Validate that enhanced content aligns with historical facts and career progression.\n    *   **Hallucination Detection**: Flag AI outputs that contradict documented historical facts.\n\n**Expected Benefits:**\n*   **Authenticity**: Significantly improved factual accuracy and authenticity of AI-generated content.\n*   **Contextual Relevance**: Enhanced AI understanding of the user's actual career trajectory.\n*   **Consistency**: Elimination of contradictory information across documents.\n*   **Personalization**: Truly personalized enhancement based on real career data.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n*   **Document Processing Engine**: A new component (e.g., `HistoricalCareerAnalyzer` as suggested in the original issue) responsible for parsing and extracting structured data from historical documents.\n*   **Integration with Enhancement Pipeline**: The extracted historical context will be loaded and provided to the `claude-enhancer.js` before AI processing.\n\n**Potential Progress:**\nNo progress has been made on this issue. The functionality needs to be implemented from scratch.\n\n**Priority:** This is a high-value enhancement that transforms the system from generic AI enhancement to authentic career development based on real professional history. It is currently **P2: Medium**, which is appropriate.",

            "body": "### 🎯 Foundation Enhancement: Historical CV/Resume Foundation Analysis via rclone\n\n**Concept Origin:**\nIntegrate existing CV/resume/application documents from Google Drive (or other cloud storage) using `rclone` to provide a rich, contextual foundation for AI enhancement. This aims to replace generic assumptions with actual career history, leading to more authentic and accurate AI-generated content.\n\n**Current Implementation:**\nThere is currently no implementation for historical career document analysis.\n*   **`rclone` Integration:** The project does not currently utilize `rclone` or any other cloud storage integration for document discovery and retrieval. The `rclone` commands mentioned in the issue body are conceptual and not integrated into any workflow or script.\n*   **Document Processing:** There are no existing modules or scripts for:\n    *   PDF/DOC text extraction.\n    *   Career timeline reconstruction from unstructured text.\n    *   Skills evolution tracking.\n    *   Achievement pattern analysis from historical documents.\n    The `cv-generator.js` and `claude-enhancer.js` primarily operate on pre-structured JSON data (`base-cv.json`, `activity-summary.json`, `ai-enhancements.json`).\n*   **Contextual AI Enhancement:** The `claude-enhancer.js` does not have a mechanism to load or leverage historical career documents for factual grounding, consistency validation, or to reflect authentic career development trajectories.\n\n**Proposed Implementation Strategy:**\n\n#### Phase 1: Document Discovery & Retrieval\n*   **Tool**: `rclone` (or similar cloud storage synchronization tool).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   Configure `rclone` to access specified cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive).\n    *   Implement scripts to search for and selectively retrieve historical career documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) to a local, untracked temporary directory.\n\n#### Phase 2: Document Analysis Pipeline\n*   **Components**: New scripts/modules (e.g., Python-based for robust text extraction and NLP).\n*   **Functionality**:\n    *   **Text Extraction**: Convert various document formats (PDF, DOCX) into analyzable plain text.\n    *   **Career Timeline Reconstruction**: Extract dates, roles, and responsibilities to build a chronological career timeline.\n    *   **Skills Evolution Tracking**: Identify and track the development and usage of skills over time.\n    *   **Achievement Pattern Analysis**: Analyze historical documents to quantify career progression and identify key achievements.\n\n#### Phase 3: Contextual AI Enhancement\n*   **Integration Point**: `claude-enhancer.js` (before AI processing).\n*   **Capabilities**:\n    *   **Factual Grounding**: Use the extracted historical career data to fact-check and ground AI-generated content, ensuring authenticity.\n    *   **Consistency Validation**: Validate that enhanced content aligns with historical facts and career progression.\n    *   **Hallucination Detection**: Flag AI outputs that contradict documented historical facts.\n\n**Expected Benefits:**\n*   **Authenticity**: Significantly improved factual accuracy and authenticity of AI-generated content.\n*   **Contextual Relevance**: Enhanced AI understanding of the user's actual career trajectory.\n*   **Consistency**: Elimination of contradictory information across documents.\n*   **Personalization**: Truly personalized enhancement based on real career data.\n\n**Technical Architecture:**\n*   **Document Processing Engine**: A new component (e.g., `HistoricalCareerAnalyzer` as suggested in the original issue) responsible for parsing and extracting structured data from historical documents.\n*   **Integration with Enhancement Pipeline**: The extracted historical context will be loaded and provided to the `claude-enhancer.js` before AI processing.\n\n**Potential Progress:**\nNo progress has been made on this issue. The functionality needs to be implemented from scratch.\n\n**Priority:** This is a high-value enhancement that transforms the system from generic AI enhancement to authentic career development based on real professional history. It is currently **P2: Medium**, which is appropriate.",

This extraneous text appears as \"artifacts\" in the final output, reducing the professionalism and conciseness of the CV.\n\n**Problematic Content Example (from \"About Me\" section):**\n```\nHere's an enhanced professional summary: **Enhanced Summary:** Results-driven AI Engineer and Software Architect who has successfully delivered 15+ autonomous systems that have increased operational efficiency by an average of 40% across enterprise clients. Combining deep expertise in Python and TypeScript with advanced machine learning implementations, I architect scalable AI solutions that bridge the gap between theoretical ML models and production-ready systems. Recognized for pioneering human-AI collaborative frameworks that have reduced decision-making latency by 60% while maintaining 99.9% system reliability, with particular focus on real-time processing and autonomous agent orchestration in mission-critical environments. This enhancement: - Opens with a strong, measurable impact statement - Incorporates specific technical expertise - Includes quantifiable achievements - Maintains credibility while highlighting excellence - Uses active, authoritative language - Focuses on business value and technical capability - Emphasizes both AI expertise and practical implementation - Concludes with specific domain focus The numbers provided are placeholders that should be adjusted to match actual achievements, but the structure effectively positions the candidate as a senior technical professional who delivers measurable business impact.\n```\nThe text \"Here's an enhanced professional summary:\" and \"This enhancement: - Opens with a strong, measurable impact statement...\" are examples of these artifacts.\n\n**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**\nThe prompt provided to the LLM (Claude AI) for generating the professional summary is likely instructing it to explain its process or provide meta-analysis alongside the generated content.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nReview and revise the prompt used to generate the \"Professional Summary\" in `claude-enhancer.js` to ensure the LLM outputs *only* the desired summary content, without any meta-commentary or extraneous explanations. This may involve:\n*   Refining instructions to be more direct and explicit about the desired output format.\n*   Utilizing XML tags (Issue #97) to clearly delineate the expected output section.\n*   Implementing post-processing in `claude-enhancer.js` to strip any remaining artifacts if prompt refinement alone is insufficient.\n\n**Related Issues:**\n*   #33: Comprehensive Prompt Engineering Overhaul for Enhanced AI Output Quality\n*   #44: Ensure narrative coherence and tone consistency in AI-enhanced content\n*   #97: Implement XML Tag Structuring for Claude Prompts\n*   #96: Integrate Few-Shot Prompting into AI Enhancement\n*   #92: Utilize System Prompts for Persona-Driven AI Responses\n*   #94: Adopt \"Tool Use\" Paradigm for Structured JSON Output\n*   #98: Develop a Version-Controlled Prompt Library\n\n**Priority:** This is a **P1: High** bug as it directly impacts the quality and professionalism of the generated CV.",

This will involve:\n\n1.  Creating a `tests` directory within each Python package.\n2.  Writing comprehensive unit tests using the `unittest` framework.\n3.  Mocking external dependencies, such as API calls, to ensure tests are fast and reliable.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n-   Unit tests are added for `nlp_utils.py`, `document_formatter.py`, and `github_api_client.py`.\n-   The tests are self-contained and do not require external services.\n-   The tests pass successfully.",

        "body": "## 🐛 **Voice Interface Failure Report**\n\nThe voice functionality in the terminal interface is currently broken and not working as expected. Users cannot activate voice commands or speech output.\n\n### 🔍 **Problem Description**\n\n**Current Status:** Voice interface fails to initialize or function properly\n**User Impact:** Complete loss of voice command functionality and accessibility features\n**Severity:** High - affects accessibility and core advertised features\n\n### 🛠 **Affected Components**\n\n**Files Involved:**\n- `assets/voice-interface.js` - Main voice interface class\n- `assets/terminal.js` - Voice integration and command handling\n- `index.html` - Voice control UI elements\n\n**UI Elements:**\n- Voice toggle button (`#voiceToggle`)\n- Speech output button (`#speechToggle`) \n- Voice status indicator (`#voiceIndicator`)\n- Voice status display (`#voiceStatus`)\n\n### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**\n\n#### **1. Browser API Requirements**\n- **Web Speech API** requires HTTPS connection\n- **Microphone permissions** must be explicitly granted\n- **User gesture** required for speech synthesis (autoplay policies)\n- **Browser compatibility** limited to Chrome/Edge primarily\n\n#### **2. Permission Handling Issues**\n```javascript\n// Current error handling in voice-interface.js:182-192\nthis.recognition.onerror = (event) => {\n  console.warn('Speech recognition error:', event.error);\n  \n  if (event.error === 'not-allowed' || event.error === 'service-not-allowed') {\n    this.showVoiceError('Microphone access required for voice interface');\n  } else if (event.error === 'network') {\n    this.showVoiceError('Network error - check internet connection');\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### **3. Initialization Sequence Problems**\n- Voice interface initialization may fail silently\n- No graceful degradation when APIs unavailable\n- Missing error feedback to user\n- Auto-restart logic may cause infinite loops\n\n### 🧪 **Expected vs Actual Behavior**\n\n**Expected:**\n- Voice toggle button activates listening\n- Wake words (\"Adrian\", \"Computer\") trigger command mode\n- Speech recognition converts voice to terminal commands\n- Text-to-speech provides audio feedback\n- Proper error messages for permission issues\n\n**Actual:**\n- Voice interface fails to start\n- No response to voice commands\n- UI indicators show error states\n- Console shows permission or API errors\n\n### 📋 **Debugging Steps Performed**\n\n#### **Browser API Support Check:**\n```javascript\n// APIs required for voice functionality:\n- window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition\n- window.speechSynthesis\n- window.SpeechSynthesisUtterance\n```\n\n#### **Common Failure Points:**\n1. **Microphone Permissions:** Not requested or denied\n2. **HTTPS Requirement:** Web Speech API requires secure context\n3. **Browser Support:** Limited to Chromium-based browsers\n4. **Network Connectivity:** Speech recognition needs internet\n5. **User Gesture:** Required for speech synthesis to work\n\n### 🔧 **Proposed Solutions**\n\n#### **1. Enhanced Permission Handling**\n- Add explicit permission request flow\n- Improve error messaging and user guidance\n- Graceful fallback when permissions denied\n\n#### **2. Initialization Improvements**\n- Better API availability detection\n- User-friendly error reporting\n- Progressive enhancement approach\n\n#### **3. Browser Compatibility**\n- Add browser support detection\n- Show compatibility warnings\n- Provide alternative interaction methods\n\n#### **4. User Experience Fixes**\n- Clear onboarding for voice setup\n- Visual feedback for permission states\n- Better error recovery mechanisms\n\n### 🧪 **Testing Requirements**\n\n**Test Cases Needed:**\n- [ ] Permission request flow\n- [ ] HTTPS vs HTTP behavior  \n- [ ] Different browser compatibility\n- [ ] Network connectivity issues\n- [ ] Microphone hardware problems\n- [ ] Speech synthesis voice loading\n- [ ] Wake word detection accuracy\n- [ ] Command recognition precision\n\n### 💡 **Implementation Priority**\n\n**High Priority:**\n1. Fix permission request flow\n2. Add proper error handling\n3. Improve user feedback\n\n**Medium Priority:**\n1. Browser compatibility warnings\n2. Enhanced wake word detection\n3. Voice command accuracy\n\n**Low Priority:**\n1. Advanced voice settings\n2. Multiple language support\n3. Voice training features\n\n### 📈 **Success Criteria**\n\n- [ ] Voice interface initializes without errors\n- [ ] Microphone permissions properly requested\n- [ ] Clear error messages for common issues\n- [ ] Wake word detection functional\n- [ ] Voice commands execute correctly\n- [ ] Speech output works as expected\n- [ ] Graceful degradation when unavailable\n\n### 🔗 **Related Issues**\n\nThis issue is related to the overall accessibility and usability of the terminal interface. Voice functionality is a core feature that affects user experience significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Priority:** High\n**Type:** Bug Fix\n**Component:** Voice Interface\n**Accessibility Impact:** Severe",

Review log files in detail before using `--move` flag\n\nThis manual testing approach needs to be supplemented with automated tests.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Test Framework Setup\n- **Bash testing framework**: Consider `bats-core` (Bash Automated Testing System)\n- **Test directory structure**: Organized test cases with sample music files\n- **CI Integration**: Ensure tests run automatically on commits/PRs\n\n### Test Categories Needed\n\n#### 1. **Unit Tests**\n- `sanitize_filename()`: Test filename sanitization with various problematic characters\n- `check_dependencies()`: Mock missing dependencies\n- `get_log_level_name()`: Test all log level mappings\n- Metadata parsing functions\n\n#### 2. **Integration Tests**  \n- **Album processing**: Test complete album analysis workflow\n- **Quality detection**: Test Lossless/Lossy/Mixed classification\n- **Path generation**: Test target directory structure creation\n- **Error handling**: Test problematic albums (missing metadata, etc.)\n\n#### 3. **End-to-End Tests**\n- **Dry-run mode**: Verify no actual file changes occur\n- **Complete workflow**: Source → Analysis → Target path planning\n- **Configuration loading**: Test config file parsing and CLI overrides\n- **Logging**: Verify log file content and format\n\n#### 4. **Edge Case Tests**\n- **Various Artists** compilations\n- **Multi-disc albums** \n- **Special characters** in metadata (Unicode, symbols)\n- **Missing/inconsistent metadata**\n- **Mixed file formats** within albums\n- **Empty directories**\n- **Symbolic links**\n\n### Test Data Requirements\nCreate test music collection with:\n- Sample albums with good metadata\n- Albums with missing/bad metadata  \n- Multi-disc albums\n- Various Artists compilations\n- Mixed quality albums (FLAC + MP3)\n- Files with problematic characters in names/metadata\n\n## Implementation Plan\n1. **Choose testing framework** (recommend `bats-core`)\n2. **Create `tests/` directory** structure\n3. **Generate test music files** (or use Creative Commons samples)\n4. **Write test cases** for each component\n5. **Add CI workflow** (GitHub Actions)\n6. **Document testing process** in README\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Automated test framework is set up and functional\n- [ ] Unit tests cover all core functions\n- [ ] Integration tests verify album processing workflow\n- [ ] End-to-end tests validate complete dry-run operations\n- [ ] Edge cases are properly tested\n- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline\n- [ ] Test coverage report is available\n- [ ] Documentation explains how to run tests\n\n## Benefits\n- **Catch regressions** during development\n- **Validate fixes** before deployment\n- **Document expected behavior** through test cases\n- **Enable confident refactoring**\n- **Ensure cross-platform compatibility**\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)",

Mismatches will be logged as errors, and the original file will be retained if possible.\n\n## Requirements\nAdd checksum verification functionality that:\n\n1. **Calculate checksums before moving**: Generate MD5 checksums for source files\n2. **Verify after moving**: Calculate checksums for moved files and compare\n3. **Handle mismatches**: \n   - Log errors when checksums don't match\n   - Retain original file if possible\n   - Mark operation as failed\n4. **Integration**: Work seamlessly with the file move functionality\n\n## Implementation Approach\n1. **New function**: `verify_file_integrity(source_file, dest_file)`\n2. **Use `md5sum`**: Already listed as dependency in `check_dependencies()`\n3. **Add to move workflow**: Call verification after each successful file move\n4. **Error handling**: Proper logging and rollback on verification failures\n\n## Suggested Implementation Location\n- Add `verify_file_integrity()` function around `music_sorter.sh:87`\n- Integrate into the actual move logic (Issue #2)\n- Add verification step after each `rsync` operation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Calculates MD5 checksums before and after file moves\n- [ ] Compares checksums and detects mismatches\n- [ ] Logs verification results (success/failure) \n- [ ] Retains original files when verification fails\n- [ ] Reports integrity issues to user\n- [ ] Does not break existing dry-run functionality\n- [ ] Integrates cleanly with file move operations\n\n## Dependencies\n- `md5sum` (already verified in dependencies)\n- File move functionality from Issue #2\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)",

It is crucial for generating highly tailored and effective application documents that are compatible with Applicant Tracking Systems.\n\n**Atomic Nature & No CI Impact:**\n-   This task involves pure Python logic and will reside in `src/python/`.\n-   Development and testing will be conducted in isolation using local Python environments.\n-   No changes will be made to existing CI workflows or core JavaScript files.\n-   Dependencies (e.g., `python-docx`, `pandoc`) will be managed locally and will not affect the current CI environment or its dependencies.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n-   A Python module (`src/python/document_formatter.py`) with functions for ATS-compliant document generation.\n-   Local unit tests for the utilities.\n\n**References:**\n-   `docs/research/autonomous-career-agent-plan.md` (Module IV: The Dynamic Candidate-Representation Suite)\n-   Issue #21: `⚠️ Follow-up: Incomplete Implementation for #9 - ATS-optimized Plain Text CV`\n-   Issue #20: `⚠️ Follow-up: Incomplete Implementation for #10 - Multi-format CV Export`",

Implementing these utilities improves the stealth and realism of future automated interactions, which is crucial for resilient web scraping.\n\n**Atomic Nature & No CI Impact:**\n-   This task involves pure Python logic and will reside in `src/python/`.\n-   Development and testing will be conducted in isolation using local Python environments (e.g., `venv`).\n-   No changes will be made to existing CI workflows (`.github/workflows/`) or core JavaScript files (`.github/scripts/`).\n-   Dependencies (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`) will be managed locally and will not affect the current CI environment or its dependencies.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n-   A Python module (`src/python/human_emulator.py` or integrated into `web_scraper.py`) containing advanced human emulation functions.\n-   Local unit tests for the implemented utilities.\n\n**References:**\n-   `docs/research/web-scraping-playbook.md` (Sections 1.3, 2.3)\n-   `docs/research/autonomous-career-agent-plan.md` (Module I: Sourcing & Discovery Engine)",

These warnings indicate the use of deprecated packages, unsupported modules, and the use of `--force` which disables recommended protections.\n\n**Observed Warnings:**\n```\nnpm warn using --force Recommended protections disabled.\nnpm warn deprecated rimraf @3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported\nnpm warn deprecated inflight @1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.\nnpm warn deprecated glob @7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported\nnpm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3: Use @eslint/object-schema instead\nnpm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0: Use @eslint/config-array instead\nnpm warn deprecated eslint @8.57.1: This version is no longer supported. Please see https://eslint.org/version-support for other options.\n```\n\n**Impact:**\n- **Security Risks**: Deprecated or unsupported modules may contain unpatched vulnerabilities.\n- **Maintainability**: Reliance on outdated packages can lead to compatibility issues with newer Node.js versions or other dependencies.\n- **Performance**: Some warnings (e.g., `inflight`) explicitly mention performance issues (memory leaks).\n- **Build Stability**: Warnings can obscure more critical errors and indicate underlying instability in the dependency tree.\n\n**Remediation:**\nInvestigate each warning and take appropriate action:\n- **`--force` usage**: Determine why `--force` is necessary and if it can be removed by resolving underlying dependency conflicts.\n- **Deprecated packages**: Update `rimraf`, `inflight`, `glob`, `@humanwhocodes/object-schema`, `@humanwhocodes/config-array`, and `eslint` to their supported versions or replace them with actively maintained alternatives.\n- **Unsupported modules**: Address the `inflight` warning by replacing the module as suggested (e.g., `lru-cache`).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- `npm install` completes without any `npm warn` messages related to deprecated or unsupported packages.\n- The `--force` flag is no longer required for `npm install`.\n- The project's dependencies are up-to-date and stable.",

This absence hinders the continuous improvement of the AI's scoring model and content optimization strategies.\n\n**Remediation:**\nImplement a mechanism to collect and integrate recruiter and peer feedback into the CV enhancement process. This could involve:\n- Designing a simple feedback collection interface or process (e.g., a web form, direct email integration).\n- Structuring feedback to be actionable and quantifiable (e.g., ratings on relevance, clarity, impact).\n- Integrating collected feedback into the scoring model to refine weights and thresholds for AI content generation.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- The system can collect structured feedback from external stakeholders (recruiters, peers).\n- Feedback is used to refine the AI's content generation and scoring models.\n- The feedback loop contributes to continuous improvement of the CV's effectiveness.",
